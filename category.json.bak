I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on New Year\u2019s resolutions. People celebrate the beginning of each year at different times depending on their cultural traditions. But one of the most common times to celebrate the New Year is by the Gregorian calendar. People also call this way of measuring days, months and years the Western or Christian calendar. On this calendar, the first day of the new year is January 1st. People call this holiday \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d.People love to celebrate New Year\u2019s Day. Some celebrate with parties and music. They may sing traditional songs about old times and good friends. Some people celebrate quietly with family and friends. Other people go to church on New Year\u2019s Day. People may ask each other, and God, for forgiveness for the wrong things that happened the year before. People can leave their mistakes in the old year. Instead, they look to the future. They think about how they can make the new year better, or different, than the year before.One common way people try to make a new beginning is by making New Year\u2019s resolutions. A  resolution is a promise you make to yourself. It usually means a change of behavior or a new goal. For example:This year, I promise to eat healthy food.This year, I promise to exercise more.I promise to give more money to the poor.I promise to be kind to my sister.I promise to finish school this year.People believe that the first New Year\u2019s resolutions were made thousands of years ago by the Babylonians. The most popular New Year\u2019s resolution for the ancient Babylonians was to return borrowed farm equipment! Today, the most popular New Year\u2019s resolutions are usually ways for people to improve themselves. People promise to do things like stop smoking or pay back money that they owe. People also commonly make resolutions about relationships and health.On the first day of the New Year people feel great about the changes they hope to make. But what happens after some time has passed? Experts say that most people do  keep their resolutions for very long! The University of Scranton in the United States studied New Year\u2019s resolutions in 2014. They found that one week after New Year\u2019s Day only 75% of people have kept their resolutions. This number drops down to 65% after one month. Less than half of people keep their New Year\u2019s resolutions for more than six months.There are many reasons why people often do not keep their resolutions. The main reason is that it is difficult to make changes. But there are a few ways to make it easier to make good changes. Spotlight producers Michio Ozaki, Bruce Gulland and Rena Dam each share a way to make \u2013 and keep, resolutions:Be realistic and detailed. Many people make a goal that is too big or not clear. Your resolution may be to learn English better. But you may not know how to make that happen! Instead, make a resolution that is smaller and more detailed. For example, \u201cI will listen to a Spotlight English program two times every week.\u201d Or, \u201cI will speak English every day.\u201d Making smaller goals will help you to get better at the exact thing you want to do. It will also make you able to measure your success. And  will be encouraging!Get as much support as you can. Ask other people to help you remember your resolutions. When you make a promise to someone else, it is easy to remember. It will also make you want to keep your resolution. Some people make resolutions with someone else. For example, if you wanted to exercise more, you could plan to exercise with a friend. Then you can encourage each other and have fun too. Even if you have no one to help you keep your resolution, there are websites on the internet that offer help. One website sends encouraging information about your resolution, such as information about exercising. The website will even send emails to help you remember your resolution.Start one new healthy habit to replace every unhealthy one. Many people make New Year\u2019s resolutions to stop bad habits. These habits may be things like eating unhealthy food, or playing too many video games. It is difficult just to  a habit. Instead, replace it with something else. For example, instead of eating unhealthy food snacks, plan healthy things to eat. Make a resolution to eat more fruits and vegetables. Or, in the case of video games, replace the habit with something healthier. Make a resolution to get more exercise. At the times you would play a video game, play a sport with your friends instead.However, sometimes a bad habit is not just a habit. Sometimes a bad habit is really an addiction. Substances like cigarettes or alcohol can cause dependence. A person\u2019s mind or body depends on these substances. For example, when you stop using cigarettes, you may feel sick. You will want the cigarettes very badly. Stopping an addiction is much more difficult than stopping a bad habit. If you are stopping an addiction, look for more help. Visit our website for more ideas.It is also good to remember that no one is perfect. Even if we fail one day, we can keep working on our resolutions. The Christian Bible uses the word perseverance to talk about keeping promises. Perseverance means continuing to do something even if it is difficult. To persevere, a person needs to be patient and strong. But we do not have to struggle alone. The Bible also says that God will be with us and help us:\u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cplans for good and not for evil, plans to give you a future and a hope.\u201dWith this hope, it is easier to have perseverance. People may forget their New Year\u2019s resolutions or want to give up. But everyone can remember these helpful ideas: Make detailed goals and get help from friends. Start new good habits as you stop old bad ones. Remind yourself and others that you are not alone. And with perseverance, good changes can last throughout the whole year.The writers of this program were Sara DeKoster and Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Nick Page. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine this situation: It is 1985. Russia and the United States are enemies.\u00a0In New York City, a man dies.This was not a normal man.\u00a0He was a superhero known as The Comedian. Superheroes with amazing powers used to keep the United States safe.\u00a0But now, most superheroes have retired or lost their power.\u00a0People in the United States are afraid.\u00a0They fear nuclear war.\u00a0They worry it could happen at any time. Many of the nation\u2019s superheroes are afraid of what is happening. But one of these heroes must decide: should he save the human race, or let them die?This is the story Watchmen, a book by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. However, Watchmen is not a normal book. It is a graphic novel. Graphic novels use both pictures and words to tell a long story. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on graphic novels.Early graphic novels started in the 1930s as comic books. A comic book tells a short story with pictures and few words. Each page of a comic book includes several squares with pictures. The pictures show what is happening in the story. The pictures also have words with them.\u00a0These words express what the characters are saying or thinking. And each picture tells the next part of the story.At first, comic books were like magazines. Each monthly comic would include a small part of a larger story.\u00a0Often these stories were about superheroes or other non-human characters.\u00a0People would have to wait each month to read the next part of the superhero\u2019s story. But in the 1970s, publishers began creating longer comic books. They did this by putting together the stories from all the comic books in a series. Soon, writers wrote longer and longer stories using comic book design. They called these longer books graphic novels.Graphic novels combine two kinds of storytelling \u2013 writing and narrative or story art.\u00a0Sometimes, a writer can have a good story idea, but she wants to tell her story with more than just words. So she creates pictures of her characters.\u00a0 These pictures show what a character looks like.\u00a0 But they can also show what the characters are doing.\u00a0 By combining pictures and words, the writer can show special details.\u00a0She can also tell a more complex story with fewer words.Like all stories, writers create graphic novels for many reasons.\u00a0Some graphic novels teach a moral lesson.\u00a0Some are just for fun.\u00a0And others help readers learn about other people, times and cultures. Not all graphic novels are about superheroes.\u00a0In fact, some of the most famous graphic novels are true stories. They are about events and situations that happened to real people.One famous example is the novel Maus. The novel\u2019s writer is named Art Spiegelman.\u00a0He lives in New York City. In the early 1980s, he wrote Maus about his father\u2019s experience during World War II. During World War II, the German Nazi army fought for control of Europe. They also tried to rid European countries of particular groups of people \u2013 including the Jews. They killed millions of people in planned executions, and in prison camps.Speigelman\u2019s father was named Vladek.\u00a0Vladek ran a factory in Poland before the war. And Vladek was Jewish.\u00a0During the war, Nazis took Vladek\u2019s factory away. They moved him to the huge prison work camp called Auschwitz. Most Jews that went to Auschwitz did not survive.\u00a0But Vladek did.\u00a0After the war, he moved to New York City.Vladek told his story to his son. And Speigelman decided to make a graphic novel about his father\u2019s experience. But instead of creating a story about people, Speigelman made the characters of the story animals.In the graphic novel Maus, the Jews are small animals called mice.\u00a0The Nazis are cats. People from Poland are pigs and people from America are dogs. There are many stories of survival from the Holocaust, but Maus makes the reader look at the story of survival in a new way.People often consider cartoons, like the drawn pictures of animals in Maus, to be funny or childlike.\u00a0So, some people may think using animal characters makes Maus less serious.\u00a0However, Lev Grossman would disagree.\u00a0Grossman is a writer for Time Magazine. He believes using cartoons in Maus makes people notice again a story we may have forgotten.\u00a0 He wrote,\u201cThose mice are more human than most people.\u201dCraig Thompson is another graphic novel writer.\u00a0As a boy, he loved reading comic books.\u00a0As an adult, he rediscovered comics and began writing graphic novels.\u00a0Thompson enjoys creating graphic novels because it combines many of his skills.\u00a0He told Mother Jones magazine,\u201c\u2026One person can do it all \u2014 do the character designs and create the background setting and write the story.\u201dIn 2003, Thompson wrote a graphic novel called Blankets. This story is based on his young adult life.\u00a0Thompson enjoys using his art skills to connect with other people.\u00a0The beauty of his art communicates much emotion and struggle.\u00a0Many people can relate to Thompson\u2019s story. He asks questions about the faith he was raised to believe.\u00a0He also tells about his first love.\u00a0In his story, many people see their own story of growing up.For many people, graphic novels help them feel closer to the story emotionally. They do not just read the words. Instead they look at the pictures too.\u00a0Readers are also part of the creative process. They must imagine what happens between the pictures and few words the writer provides.\u00a0They must work harder to understand the story.\u00a0And for many readers, this helps them remember the story better.The best thing about graphic novels may be the slowness of the reading process.\u00a0Graphic novels provide a chance to slow down and think about the story. Thompson told Mother Jones,\u201cThere is something natural about the slowness of reading graphic novels. There is something natural about wanting to resist the fast speed of modern, popular culture. With the graphic novel, it is the opposite of fast speed popular culture \u2013 it is about resisting all the internet culture.\u201dThe writer and producer of this program was Dianna Anderson\u00a0The voices you heard were from the United States and the United Kingdom. All quotes were adapted and voiced by Spotlight. You can find our programs on the internet at\u00a0. This program is called \u201cPicture Stories.\u201dWe hope you can join us again for the next Spotlight program. Goodbye.Do you read graphic novels? If you do, what is your favorite graphic novel?

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Isadore Charters stands on a beautiful hill in the country of Canada. He looks out at the fields of grass. He sees mountains in the distance. Charters\u2019 hair is now grey. But he remembers many happy days on these hills. When he was a child, he ran over the grass and climbed trees. But when he was young, nobody called him Isadore Charters. The only name he knew was Yenmo Ceetza. His family called him Yummo. But one sad day, officials took Yummo away. They placed him in a government school, far away from his family. And they called him Isadore Charters. Officials took Charters away from everything he knew. And it has taken him many years to find peace and recover from this hurt. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Isadore Charters and his story of faith and healing.Charters is a member of the Okanagan and Thompson tribes. These are two of Canada\u2019s first nations \u2013 the native people who lived in Canada before Europeans arrived. Charters\u2019 ancestors had lived in the hill country of Western Canada for thousands of years.As a child, Charters loved his tribe. And he loved living on their land. But when he was six years old, his life changed. One morning a truck came to his home. Officials took Charters and his brothers. They put the boys in the truck. The truck was filled with other crying children. All the children were from first nations tribes. And the government was placing them in government managed residential schools \u2013 far from their homes. The Canadian government threatened the native parents. If they did not send their children to the residential school, the government would send the parents to prison.This is a common story for many first nations tribe members in Canada. From 1876 to 1996, the Canadian government forced 150,000 first nations children to attend residential schools. The goal of these schools was to force native children to become part of the majority culture. School officials worked to rid Canada of first nations culture. You can hear more about these schools in an earlier Spotlight program called .Charters lived at a residential school managed by the Catholic Church. When he arrived, a nun told him that his name was not Yummo. This female religious worker told him that his English name was Isadore Charters. And from then on, she said that he must only be Isadore Charters. The nuns told Charters that native culture was evil. They said that he needed to forget the ways of his tribe. And they did not let him speak his tribal language. Charters told the Chilliwack Progress news organization,\u201cThey took away who I was \u2013 my language, my traditions, my culture.\u201dOne of the nuns at the school was very kind to Charters. She talked about the love of God and her Christian faith. At times, Charters said he could feel God even at the school. Over time, Charters struggled with the idea of becoming a Christian. The school was managed by Christian leaders that did not respect him or his culture. But he believed strongly in God, and he wanted to become a saint \u2013 a holy person of the Christian church. So one day, he got on his knees. He placed his back toward the school and his face toward the grass of the fields. He told God that he wanted to become a Saint. Charters told Spotlight,\u201cGod was there. We were talking. He was talking to me, and I knew he was there.\u201dBut very soon after that, Charters stopped believing in God. He experienced a terrible tragedy. A worker at the school began to molest him. This person forced Charters to perform sexual acts with him.Charters became very angry \u2013 at the worker and at God. He began using art to express his pain and anger. He made pictures of snakes coming out of peoples\u2019 mouths and pictures with knives and blood. After a short time, Charters began to drink alcohol. He thought alcohol would help get rid of his pain. By the time he was 12 years old, Charters was an alcoholic. He could no longer control his use of alcohol.As an adult, Charters recognized that he needed to stop drinking. After many years, he decided to seek help. He looked to God and his native culture. Members of other tribes helped him. They prayed with him and encouraged him. This time was very healing for Charters. He came to recognize that he did not have to give up his culture to be a Christian. And he did not have to stop being a Christian to honor his culture.Charters believes that God was speaking to his first nations people all through their history. He thinks that their beliefs prepared them to hear the message of Jesus. He told Spotlight,\u201cOur people already knew there was a special person on the earth. That is why it is easy for them to believe in Jesus.\u201dAfter he stopped drinking, Charters went to  school. Today, he uses art to express the healing he has experienced \u2013 instead of only pain and anger. He paints pictures of first nations stories that he remembers from his childhood.Charters also believes that there needs to be healing between the larger Canadian and first nations cultures. So, Charters proposed an idea to help share his story and encourage healing. He decided to carve a totem pole. Totem poles are important in the native culture of Western Canada. A totem pole is a tall piece of wood. An artist uses sharp tools to carve pictures and symbols into the pole. These pictures tell a story.Charters decided that he would carve a totem pole that told the story of his healing. And he wanted other people to help him carve it. So, Charters traveled to schools, universities, churches and public places. He told his story, and then he invited people to help him. He gave them sharp tools to carve. Then, they could be a part of the healing \u2013 not just Charters\u2019 healing, but Canada\u2019s healing.When the healing pole was finished, Charters took it to the residential school where he lived, the school in Kamloops. This particular school was one of the largest residential schools in Canada. The pole was permanently placed in the ground. When it was installed, the community held a celebration to honor the totem pole. The community performed a first nations power dance. Then, they prayed together. And the very place that caused so much pain can now be a place of hope for the future.Have you ever seen art help in the process of healing?

I\u2019m Joshua Leo.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand \u2013 no matter where in the world they live.A woman sits on a high, green mountain side in Peru. She watches her animals \u2013 a group of sheep and alpacas. She keeps these animals for their hairy wool. The woman is careful to watch the alpaca, but she is also busy in another way. She is weaving wool from the animals to make a colorful cloth. It can be used for clothes, or in a home. She learned this traditional skill from her mother. And she continues to teach her daughters, and other women in her village. She hopes that weaving cloth will create a better future for her community.The woman is working with the organization Awamaki. Awamaki supports native Quechua communities in Peru. These traditional communities are very poor. But they have a deep cultural history to share with the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Awamaki and their work with the Quechua weavers of Peru.The Quechua people live in the high Andes mountains in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile. They live a simple life. It is centred on farming and family. They raise sheep. But they also raise many kinds of camelid animals \u2013 llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1a, and guanacos. They use these animals for food. But they also use their hairy wool to make clothing and art.Each kind of camelid animal has a different kind of wool. Llama wool is very rough. They use it mostly for making rope or bags. Vicu\u00f1a wool is very soft, but can only be harvested every few years. However, people can harvest alpaca wool often. This fine wool is softer and warmer than sheep wool. Baby alpaca wool is the softest and most valued alpaca wool. It is used for fine clothes and scarves for warmth.The Quechua people also use the wool from these animals to make weavings. Then, they use these weavings to make warm clothes, pieces of art, blankets, and more. The images in Quechua weavings are shared through generations. A weaver repeats images again and again in a weaving. Weavers choose images for their meaning and history. These images include animals, plants, gods, people from history, water, and the stars. The image may not be clear immediately. For example, the whole animal may not appear. The weaver may only show the marks from its feet. A talented weaver combines many different images.Awamaki is based in the town of Ollantaytambo. Ollantaytambo is in what is called \u201cThe Sacred Valley\u201d of Peru. This area is high in the Andes between Machu Picchu and Cusco. More than 500 years ago, it was part of the Incan empire \u2013 this people group ruled a large area stretching through many countries in South America. Ollantaytambo is a beautiful example of a traditional Incan town. People still use the original Incan walls, farming terraces, and irrigation channels, used to bring water to farms and villages. Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists come through this area each year. They want to see these Incan places, and the Quechua people. Many women in this area weave traditional cloth. And they sell the clothes and other products to tourists. But in the past, they did not get fair prices for their work. They did not know the best things to sell to tourists. And this is how Awamaki helps.Awamaki has four main goals. First, they want to make sure the tradition of Quechua weaving continues. They are helping the Quechua women bring their work to the market, and get a fair price.Second, Awamaki wants to help the women sell their work around the world. They sell the traditional weaving and clothes over the internet. But Awamaki also connects the women with clothing designers in other countries. They work together to make new and interesting designs.Third, Awamaki also wants to improve the lives of the weavers, their families, and their communities. The women of Awamaki have a regular income. They can depend on earning money each month. The money earned also goes back to their communities. Some of the money is saved in a medical fund for the women and their children. If a medical emergency comes up, the women can use this money to help their families.Finally, Awamaki is helping to save traditional weaving methods. To weave their cloth, Quechua weavers use a backstrap loom. This kind of weaving is special to Quechua weavers. A weaver working with this loom will sit on the ground. One end of the loom attaches to a pole or stick in the ground. The other end of the loom attaches to the weaver by a strap around their back. The backstrap loom is very easy to carry. A weaver can roll it up and take it with her. If she is watching her sheep or llamas in the field, she can bring her loom. If she is visiting friends, she can bring her loom. Awamaki wants to protect this way of weaving.Through Awamaki, the women also learn new weaving skills. They go on field trips to meet other weavers. By meeting other weavers, they have a chance to learn and improve their skills. Awamaki is also teaching the Quechua women how to use natural dyes. These dyes colour the cloth. In the past, Quechua people dyed all cloth naturally. They would use things like plants, insects, roots, fruits, and seeds. More recently, traders have been bringing new chemical dyes to the weavers. These dyes are cheap. They are also easier \u2013 the women do not have to take time to gather and prepare natural dyes.As a result, many Quechua women forgot or never learned how to use natural dyes. This tradition was about to be lost. But Awamaki trains their weavers to use the natural dyes again. The women are re-learning the old ways of dying wool. The natural colors are much softer, and more beautiful.These Quechua women are changing their lives. Their work is valued. They earn a fair payment for their weavings. And they can depend on this money each month. They are learning new dying, spinning, and weaving skills. They are able to take care of their families. Through Awamaki, they are building their community.The writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from the United States.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Think about a time when someone helped you in a big way. You probably wanted to say thank you to that person in a special way. We all want to say thank you sometimes! In the United Kingdom, one very old man decided to say thank you in an interesting way. He wanted to thank the doctors and nurses who helped him when he was sick. But Tom Moore did not just want to  \u2018thank you\u2019. He wanted to  something. What he did had amazing results. And it encouraged people around the world as they all faced a difficult time. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Tom Moore and his special \u2018thank you\u2019.Tom Moore was born in April, 1920. At age 98, he fell and broke his hip bone. He received treatment from the doctors and nurses of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service.By 2020 he was back at home with his family. He had recovered well. But he now had to use a walker. This special frame, or support, helped him walk. He wanted to say a special \u2018thank you\u2019 to the doctors and nurses who had helped him to recover.But at this time people around the world were suffering from the COVID19 virus. This coronavirus could be deadly. In the United Kingdom, the government told everyone to stay at home. They said people needed to stay at home to protect the health service. Doctors and nurses were very busy in hospitals taking care of people who were sick and dying from the coronavirus. If too many people became sick the health service would not be able to serve everyone. More people would die.So like everyone else Moore had to stay at home. But he wanted to raise \u00a31000 for charities to help doctors and nurses. He knew that they needed special support during the coronavirus crisis. So he decided that he would walk 100 times around the garden at his home. He wanted to do this before his 100th birthday. He would ask people to give money while he walked.So on the 9 of April his family launched a JustGiving fundraiser. JustGiving is an online tool that helps people raise money for good causes.Local newspapers and television reported the story. People reacted immediately and started to give money to his cause. In just one day the family had to increase the target to \u00a3100,000.The next day, Moore appeared on national BBC television. He wanted people to help him support the doctors and nurses of the health service. By this time, everyone knew that Moore had been a soldier and called him \u2018Captain Tom\u2019. As a soldier, he had experienced rough and difficult times in his long life. Because of this, the BBC asked him if he could encourage people about the future. He replied,\u2018Remember, tomorrow is a good day. Tomorrow you will perhaps discover everything will be much better than today.\u2019People across the country loved what he said. And they loved what he was doing. Every day, Captain Tom slowly walked in his garden. Every day, people quickly gave money. By April 14, 2020 he had raised \u00a31,000,000. It had only been five days! Money continued to come. Captain Tom was surprised but pleased and said,\u2018Three, four, five million. I turn my back for a few minutes, and it has gone up again.\u2019People saw Captain Tom as a point of light in dark days of coronavirus. Every day, people had seen reports of increasing numbers of deaths from coronavirus. Now every day they watched the increasing amount of money Captain Tom raised. He was giving them hope when they needed it.On April 16, Captain Tom completed his official walk. He had raised over 12 million pounds. People from over 50 countries had given money. He had inspired and encouraged people around the world. From India to Saudi Arabia people reported the good news of his achievement. The head of the World Health Organisation said it united people.Captain Tom kept walking. By his 100th birthday on the 30th of April he had raised over 31 million pounds. He had given people something positive to concentrate on. Now they wanted to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to .About 140,000 people sent him cards for his 100th birthday. Airplanes flew over his home. A train was named after him. Artists produced many works of art in his honour. Many famous people sent him special messages. The UK Prime Minister recorded a message for him that said,\u2018Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the whole nation. You are a point of light in all our lives.\u2019On the 17th of July, a few months later, the Queen thanked Captain Tom in a very special way. She knighted him. This is the highest honour in the UK. It means he is now called Captain  Thomas Moore.Captain Sir Tom had raised over 32 million pounds. This money came from over one and a half million supporters in 53 different countries. It was the largest single JustGiving appeal. The money raised supported the well-being of doctors, nurses and patients. It bought simple things that made their lives easier in a difficult time. For example, it bought food and drink, quiet rooms, and cream to heal hands made rough from washing.During the coronavirus crisis many people were inspired by Captain Tom. They followed his example. Some people did their own walks to raise money for good causes. But everyone can help in some way during a crisis. Help can come in the form of a letter or a simple telephone call asking how someone is doing. Sometimes people feel that they cannot do anything to help. But we must remember that simple offers of help can have big results.Have you ever said \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone who helped you in a difficult time? How have you helped someone else?

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In 1756 a baby was born in the city of Salzburg. His family was very musical. The father played the violin for the ruler of the city. The mother loved to sing. The older daughter played the instrument called the clavier, which came before modern pianos. But this baby was different. This baby would become very,\u00a0\u00a0good at playing music. When we say his family name today, people only think of him. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his music.Mozart was only three years old when he discovered music. He climbed on the seat of the clavier and began to press the keys. He liked how the different keys made different sounds. Soon his father began to teach him music. His father was very serious about music. But Mozart loved music so it never felt like work. When Mozart was only five years old he wrote, or , music that people still play today. This music is the Minuet in G.When people came to visit the family, Mozart\u2019s father made his children play music. People were amazed. But Mozart\u2019s father wanted his children to play music for important people. He wanted them to perform for kings and princes in Europe. He decided to bring the children to the city of Vienna in Austria. There, they would play for the Empress Maria Teresa.They took many days to travel to Vienna. But Mozart had the chance to play before the empress. He was only six years old. His hands were small. His feet did not touch the floor. But he played like a skilled adult.Everyone was amazed. The empress gave the children gifts. She paid Mozart\u2019s father to teach her own children music. She asked Mozart to come back and play again and again.But Mozart\u2019s father wanted his family to be more famous. He wanted to travel all over Europe. At that time, there were no ways to record music. A musician could only make money performing in front of people. The best situation was to play for kings and queens. So Mozart\u2019s father made his son travel and play music. Mozart played for the kings and queens of France and England.This was not an easy life. Clair Huchet Bishop wrote a book about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s childhood. It is called Mozart: Music Magician. In her book she writes,\u201cWolfgang and his sister were tired. They had been gone from home for nearly three years. Travelling was not easy. The places they stayed were not always comfortable. It was difficult to meet new people and to entertain them hour after hour. The children also had to practice every day. And Mozart  new music as well.\u201dMozart composed his first symphony at age eight. This is the first opera Mozart wrote. It is called Apollo et Hyacinthus. Operas are complex pieces of music. They tell a story through instrumental music and singing. Mozart wrote this opera at the age of 11. The opera tells an old Greek myth.As he grew, Mozart played less and less for kings and queens. He got a job playing music for the ruler of Saltzburg, like his father. But it did not earn a lot of money. But Mozart wanted more. At age 22, he decided to leave his job and move to Vienna like he did when he was a child.In Vienna, Mozart married and started a family. He continued making beautiful, complex music. He was able to live in a nice home. Mozart had many wonderful times in the years that followed. He wrote over 600 musical works. These included operas, symphonies, and all kinds of other music. He met more kings and queens. His music helped make the piano a popular instrument. However, there were also many times when Mozart did not have enough money. He did not want to compose music for rich people. He wanted to  new, creative kinds of music.Mozart died in 1791. He was only 35 years old. There was a false rumor about his death. It said that someone poisoned Mozart. But today, experts believe he probably died of a common infection or sickness. He was buried in a place for people who do not have much money. Since it was a common grave, it was not marked with a stone just for Mozart. So, even today, no one knows where Mozart is buried.Today, many people consider Mozart to be one of the greatest writers of classical music. But most people do not listen to Mozart\u2019s music, unless it is in films or television. Richard Taruskin is a music teacher and writer. He wrote about Mozart for the New York Times. He argued that for many people, listening to Mozart\u2019s music became a sign of being wealthy, educated, and high-class. But he does not think this should be. He believes that everyone should listen to Mozart. In his article, Taruskin shares a quote from another famous music composer. It is the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\u201cMozart was as pure as an angel and his music is full of God\u2019s beauty. It contains all the points of all beauty in the world of music.\u201dHave you ever listened to the music of Mozart? Do you think Mozart\u2019s music matters? Do you have a favorite music composer?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.People are eating out at Moomin Caf\u00e9, a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. Some people sit with their friends while they eat. Other people may not have brought friends. But instead of being alone, they are sitting with large stuffed animals. These white animals are not alive. They are toys as large as humans. The toy Moomin is based on a cartoon animal from Finland. They are cute and fun. But they also have another purpose. They help people who come to the restaurant by themselves to feel less lonely.More and more people around the world eat by themselves. Forbes magazine reports that in the U.S., adults eat nearly half of their meals alone. Some researchers have found that eating alone is not good for people\u2019s health. Others think that it is a good experience to eat meals by yourself. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on eating alone.In many places, people feel strange eating out alone. And most restaurants do not have stuffed toys to keep their customers company! But the Telegraph reports that this is changing:\u201cEight in ten people in the United Kingdom believe that eating alone is more socially acceptable than it was five years ago. Almost a third of Britons have done so in the last month. And a third of these had done it in the last week. This shows that the shame of the table for one is on the way out.\u201dMany parts of our world are changing quickly. This affects how people eat, and who they eat with. Many people are moving to new cities. Others have jobs where they travel far from home. People must sometimes eat in restaurants in places where they do not know anyone. The structure of families is also changing. A study published in the health magazine Obesity Research & Clinical Practice looked at this issue. This study, from South Korea, explained how changing family structures influence the way we eat. Time Magazine reported on the study:\u201cFamilies in many regions of the world have become smaller in recent decades. There are also more one-person homes. Studies find that \u2018at the same time, eating patterns have become irregular, informal, and individualized in the form of more eating alone\u2019.\u201dThis study also found that eating alone can be bad for people\u2019s bodies. Men who ate at least two meals alone every day, were more likely to have some particular health issues. These issues include higher risk for heart disease and diabetes. Men who ate alone were also more likely to be obese. Eating alone is also connected to emotional health such as feelings of loneliness.But there can be good things about eating alone too! Sometimes people use this as a time to be thoughtful and thankful about their lives. Or maybe it is just a moment of quiet time to think. If you eat alone, you can also eat whatever you want. This might lead to unhealthy food choices for some people. But it is an opportunity to concentrate on what you need for your own health and happiness. And, if you go out alone, you might meet new people and find a new friendship.The Moomin Caf\u00e9 in Japan welcomes people dining alone with a stuffed animal. But in other restaurants people can eat alone in a different way. Another restaurant that is especially for people eating alone is in the Netherlands. It is a small pop-up restaurant so it can move to different locations. It is named Eenmaal. This means \u2018one meal\u2019 or \u2018one time\u2019 in English. At Eenmaal, there are only tables for one. Each meal is perfectly sized for one person. No one is permitted to bring in cell phones or computers. Customers read books. They enjoy fresh food and their own company. Marina van Goor designed Eenmaal. She tells OZY.com about Eenmaal\u2019s social influence:\u201cWe wanted to break the very well-known shame of eating out alone. I noticed that in our society, there is actually no room for being alone in public spaces. We could create a franchise of many more restaurants like this one. I strongly believe it will work anywhere, and there is a need for it.\u201dModern lifestyles and technology can make people very busy all the time. Many people have smartphones with them everywhere they go. People may even go out to eat with others but spend most of the meal on their phones! Layla Khoury-Hanold experimented with eating out every day by herself. She did this for a week. She wrote an article about it for the website Refinery29. She did not let herself use her smartphone while she was eating out. She was worried that people would stare at her. But they did not. Khoury-Hanold writes about what she noticed instead:\u201cI was getting bored and had to almost sit on my hands. Otherwise I would pull my phone out of my purse and disappear into Instagram. But when I looked around the room, I realized that more than half of the diners were staring at phone screens. They were not staring at me. They were not even looking at the people sitting across from them!\u201dThe modern world has changed the way we live and eat. Some people might really be eating \u201calone\u201d even when they are out with other people! It is not important who people eat with. It is how much they concentrate on what they are experiencing. In this way, a meal alone can be just as good, or even better, than a meal with others.Eating alone can be a lonely experience. But it can also be a wonderful one. Many people even enjoy eating meals alone. Of course, eating is an important part of every culture around the world. But if you cannot eat with friends, you can still enjoy good food and good company \u2013 your own!How many meals a week do you eat by yourself? Do you feel comfortable going out to eat alone?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Vu Ngoc Anh stands on a performance stage. Bright lights shine on her from above. Hundreds of people are watching her. They are interested in her beautiful clothing. She is wearing a kind of traditional Vietnamese clothing called an Ao Dai or Ao Dai.Ngoc Anh walks slowly across the stage. Her Ao Dai moves gently side to side. This is because it is made of soft silk \u2013 a light, flowing material. The Ao Dai is two pieces of clothing. The bottom part is loose trousers or pants. The top is a long, fitted shirt or gown. Ngoc Anh\u2019s trousers are white. Her gown is a golden, yellow color. It covers her arms, down to her wrists. And it fits tightly around her chest and neck. It is long and hangs almost to the ground. The gown is split at the sides. It opens on the sides from her waist to the floor. As Ngoc Anh walks across the floor, she looks as if she is floating.On that night, Vu Ngoc Anh won the 2012 Miss Vietnam Ao Dai competition. The judges thought she looked the most beautiful in her Ao Dai. It is a great honor to achieve the title \u201cMiss Ao Dai\u201d. This is because the Ao Dai is more than just traditional Vietnamese clothing. It is a symbol of the history and beauty of the Vietnamese culture and people. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Vietnamese Ao Dai.The Ao Dai has a long history in Vietnam. Experts believe forms of the Ao Dai have existed for hundreds of years. It is part of Vietnamese identity. But that does not mean it has stayed the same. The people making Ao Dais have used their designs to react to changes in culture. At different times, French or Chinese culture has influenced Ao Dai designs. Sometimes people changed their designs to be more like other cultures. At other times, people designed Ao Dais to show that Vietnam was a free and independent country.During the 1930s, one of the most famous designers was Nguyen Cat Tuong. He was also known as Le Mur in French. He made a new design that was particularly for women. He was influenced by some of the new French clothing. But what he designed was not French. Instead, it was a new, modern version of the Ao Dai. Before, the Ao Dai was loose and plain. But the new design was more fitted.This modern Ao Dai became very popular in parts of Vietnam from 1960-1975. After 1975, Vietnamese women did not wear the Ao Dai as often. The Vietnamese economy was struggling. Most people did not think paying for a nice Ao Dai was necessary.However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Ao Dai\u00a0 became popular again. In 1989, a Ho Chi Minh City newspaper began the first \u201cMiss Ao Dai\u201d competition. Sixteen thousand people attended the competition. But this was only the beginning of the Ao Dai\u2019s new popularity. From Ho Chi Minh City, Miss Ao Dai competitions spread around the world. They went to places like Long Beach, California in the United States and the city of Toronto, in Canada. Today, there are many countries that have large populations of Vietnamese immigrants. When these people moved out of Vietnam, they brought the Ao Dai with them.Originally, each woman\u2019s Ao Dai was made just for her. Ao Dai makers sewed each Ao Dai using only a sharp needle, thread and her hands. A woman visited her Ao Dai maker many times to make sure her Ao Dai fit perfectly. Today, factories produce Ao Dais in large numbers. These Ao Dais are sold in Vietnam and around the world. The export of the Ao Dai has influenced global clothing designers as far away as Paris, France and New York City.Even now the Ao Dai continues to change. Women want different things from their clothing. They want to keep the Ao Dai. But they want to react to changes in global clothing as well. Still, wearing the Ao Dai has special meaning. Kimlai Yingling is a Vietnamese American writer. On her website, she explained what the Ao Dai meant to her as a child.\u201cI remember when I was a little girl. I would walk into my mom and dad\u2019s rooms. Behind the door hung long pieces of fabric. I knew these beautiful pieces of material were going to be made into Ao Dais\u2026I remember staring up at my mom when she wore her Ao Dai. I would think how beautiful she looked. I could not wait until I could have an Ao Dai for myself.\u201dWe asked Vietnamese Spotlight listeners when Vietnamese women wear the Ao Dai. Listener Cong Le explained,\u201cWomen usually wear the Ao Dai during official holiday celebrations.\u201dListener Trinh Hoang said,\u201cI think all women in Vietnam wear the Ao Dai at least one time \u2013 when they get married.\u201dAnd Nguyen Tran told us,\u201cWhen I studied in high school, I wore the Ao Dai six days each week.\u201dIn Vietnam, women wear many different colors of Ao Dai. Usually younger women wear light colors. And older women wear darker or bolder colors. Spotlight listener Tuan Anh Nguyen explained,\u201cEvery different Ao Dai color and design shows the beauty and character of the person wearing it. For example, students wear a white Ao dai. This shows purity, innocence, and young beauty. A woman may wear a pink Ao dai at her wedding, when she marries. This shows graceful beauty.\u201dThe Ao Dai continues to be popular in Vietnam. And people in Vietnam are proud to share the Ao Dai with people around the world. As Tuan Anh writes,\u201cThe Ao Dai is the pride of the nation. It is the pride of every woman, every time she puts it on.\u201dHave you ever seen an Ao Dai? Does your country have any special clothing? Tell us about it. You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.On August 12, 2018, Hawk Newsome was visiting Washington DC, in the United States. He was walking with a crowd of people. They were all a part of an eight-day march. This peaceful protest was called the Agape March.Agape is a Greek word that means \u201clove\u201d. But agape is not just any kind of love. This love means that we give of ourselves for others. When we practice agape love, we are seeking the best for another person \u2014 even through our own sacrifice. The goal of the Agape March was to spread love. This kind of love is the opposite of hate.Today\u2019s Spotlight program is the first in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at 10 ways to fight hate.Hate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. Hate can lead people to do horrible things, like hate crimes. A person commits a hate crime because he hates that the other person is different. Hate crimes can take many different forms. Hate crimes may be violent. Or they may be non-violent. But they are very damaging to people and communities. They always are meant to scare or hurt other people.The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of . In today\u2019s program we will look at the first way to fight hate in your community: Act.Hawk Newsome wanted to act because of what he had seen a year before. One year before, in Charlottesville, Virginia, a hate group formed rallies and shouted hateful words. Violence broke out between the hate group and protesters. During the violence, a man drove his car into the protestors. He killed a woman and injured 19 more people. This incident affected Newsome. This is why he began the Agape March. He told Newsweek,\u201cI was in Charlottesville last year. I saw the tear gas, the rocks, and the guns. I saw the power of hate. What I want to see now is the power of love.\u201dHate crime happens in many places around the world. Maybe you have seen or experienced a hate crime for yourself. People who observe or experience hate crimes often feel helpless or alone. But it is important to remember that you do have the power to stop hate. You are not alone. Many people in your community also want to stop hate.Imagine if you read about the violence in Charlottesville. What would you have done? The Southern Poverty Law Center, or SPLC, says that when you observe a hate crime you could react in two different ways. First, you could do nothing. You could continue living your life as you are. Or you could react in a completely different way. You could do something. They suggest that you \u201crise up, speak up and stand up against hate.\u201d People must act out against hate crimes. Hate will continue if people do not act.People who commit crimes because of hate are not only attacking one person or group. The hate crime in Charlottesville influenced the whole community. Hate tears communities apart. When communities are in conflict, all members of the community suffer. Experts say that hate crimes encourage community conflict and riots more than any other crimes.So, the SPLC suggests that people should react to hate crimes by doing good things. In one city in West Virginia, vandals wrote words of hate on the outside wall of a building. A teacher at a school nearby discussed this act of vandalism with his students. The children wanted to fight this form of hate crime. They decided to paint over the hateful words. The vandals sent a message of hate. But the students sent another message. They sent a message saying that they did not want hate in their community.People who commit hate crimes can see if people do not react. The students reacted. The criminals could see that the community did not agree with their words of hate.What can you do to fight hate in your community? That is not an easy question. But there are many things to try. You can lead a prayer, paint over vandalism, or speak in your place of worship, or school. You can work with others to lead a meeting in your community and think of ideas to stop hate crimes. You can organize a rally. Gather many people together to protest hate. If you are an artist, offer to make materials to inform other people about the anti -hate rallies. If you play an instrument offer to perform at a concert to raise money to fight hate.Hawk Newsome saw the power of hate. He was sad and angry because of the injustice he had seen. He believed that a change was necessary. Otherwise, more violence like the kind people saw in Charlottesville would happen again. He wanted to make a difference. So he worked with other people to make the Agape March. He told Newsweek:\u201cThis march is an exercise of love. A revolutionary love.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine this situation. You studied very hard in school. Now you have finished. You dreamed of getting a good job in the United States. Finally, your dream came true. It is your first day of work. Now, you are walking into your work place on the first day. You see your supervisor \u2013 the person who will be your boss and tell you what to do. Your supervisor reaches out a hand. Suddenly you are not sure what to do! Should you reach out your hand too? Should you say something or wait for your supervisor to speak first? What should you do?Today\u2019s Spotlight is on work culture. Each work place has its own culture. This culture guides the way supervisors and employees talk to each other. The values of a company influence a workplace culture. The culture of the country where you work can also influence work culture. Some people may move to a new country to take a new job. They may not know what to expect in a new culture. It can be difficult to know the right behavior in new situations. It can even be difficult to know the best way to communicate. In today\u2019s program we share a few things people can do to learn the culture at their work place.Immihelp.com is a website that gives advice for people moving to and working in the United States. They give general advice about many things people may experience there. One area where they offer advice is work culture. On their website, they say:\u201cPeople in the U.S. have many different kinds of jobs. Work culture and office environment may be different across different industries and different parts of the country. Even different companies in the same industry and in the same area may have different work cultures.\u201dImmihelp is a website particularly for people living in the US. But this idea is true no matter where in the world people work and live. Every work culture is different. So it is difficult to make or follow an exact list of rules that helps in every situation. However, there are some general methods people can follow to learn the culture of a work place. This advice can be helpful for any person starting a job. This advice may also be helpful to people who are experiencing problems at their current job.Everyone who works should know the rules. When you begin working at any job, you can ask for the employee . Most work places make this list of rules. Read through the rules. They should tell you rules about taking holidays or vacation, policies about using the computer, and other helpful rules.An employee manual will also tell the dress code. The dress code tells what clothes are good to wear at that work place. Some work places require employees to wear a uniform. Others require employees to wear formal clothes, and others do not require any special clothes at all.A written rule guide is very helpful. But many work culture rules are not written. One good way to learn a work culture is to observe your co-workers, the people that you work with. For example, observe how people greet each other. Is it different when a boss greets an employee? What happens when co-workers greet each other? It can be helpful to watch these greetings and then use them yourself.You can also learn other social rules from observation. For example, different cultures have different rules about how close to stand to another person. The website skillsconnect is for immigrants finding jobs in Canada. They write this advice on their website.\u201cWatch your co-workers\u2019 body language and change yours to fit in. For example, Canadians are most comfortable with 18 inches between each other when meeting or talking. Standing closer is considered rude and invasive. Standing further away appears that you are not interested in the other person, or that you are too shy.\u201dObserving behavior in an office is one good thing to do. But it can also help to talk with your co-workers. This advice comes from Satheesh Kumar. He is from India. Kumar studied computers there. Then he got a job in the United States. He noticed the work cultures of the two countries were very different. Kumar began a blog to tell other people from India coming to work in the US what they could expect. On his blog he says that a simple thing can help you gain trust from your co-workers. That thing is eating the lunch meal with them! He says:\u201cIt is probably very common for people to eat lunch with co-workers. But some do not understand the importance of it in the working world. It is especially important when you are working in a different country like in the US and in a different work culture.\u201dKumar explains that while you are all eating a meal, you can talk about things other than work. You can talk about a person\u2019s family or the things they are interested in. It is also a chance to ask about the culture you are in, and to share information about your own culture. Most of all, it is a chance to build a personal relationship.Finally, do not be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure how to do something, or what is accepted, you can ask someone else. Immihelp writes on their website:\u201cIf you are not sure about something at your work, do not act like you know it. Admit it honestly and go ask the right person. Concentrate on key areas of knowledge. Develop your skills accordingly. Do not act like you know everything. Sooner or later, people will discover that you do not know. And that may negatively affect your performance.\u201dThere can be many things to learn and remember when you start a new job. In the beginning, it can be difficult. But if you keep a positive attitude and try, you will do well.The writer of this program was Liz Waid. The producer was Mark Drenth. The voices you heard were from the United States.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.All over the world people love  flowers. They smell good. And they look beautiful. In many countries people give flowers to each other as gifts. People may give flowers to say, \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019, \u2018Thank You\u2019 or \u2018I love you\u2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some people who give flowers get them from their own land or fields. Other people buy flowers from a market or store. Sometimes these flowers come from the local area. But often they have travelled thousands of kilometres. They have come from another country.One listener from Cayambe Ecuador told Spotlight that he works on a flower farm. The farm grows beautiful roses. Workers cut the roses and they are sent around the world. But Ecuador is only one place that sells cut flowers like this. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the global flower industry.Flowers are a form of natural beauty. But they are also big business. The cut flower industry is extremely successful. Experts estimate that this global trade is worth more than 100 billion dollars every year.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For many years countries in Western Europe led the cut flower industry. The Netherlands was the centre of the industry. It was the major producer of cut flowers. It was the most important cut flower trading nation. Today the Netherlands is still the largest exporter of cut flowers in the world. But there have been changes in the last 20 years. Developing countries have successfully entered the flower industry. They have even reduced the Netherlands\u2019 global share of exports. Countries such as Kenya, Colombia and Ecuador are new centres of production.So which countries buy all of these flowers? People in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the world\u2019s biggest buyers of cut flowers. Many of the flowers they buy are imported. For example, 82%\u00a0of cut flowers sold in the United States have been imported. The United States gets most its flowers from Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. Europe imports many of its flowers from countries in Africa like Kenya.Developing countries like Ecuador, Colombia and Kenya are successful in the cut flower industry. These countries even have some advantages over countries in Western Europe. They have much better climates for producing flowers like roses. The temperature is warm all year. And labour costs less too. Flower farms use a lot of labour to grow flowers. So many people are able to work and earn money in the industry.Nathalie Cely was the Ambassador of Ecuador to the United States. In the Huffington Post she explained that the flower industry is very important.\u2018One out of every four roses bought in the United States comes from Ecuador. The rose industry in Ecuador provides good paying jobs for thousands of poor country women. Many of these women are heads of families.\u2019But countries like Ecuador, Colombia and Kenya are thousands of kilometres away from their European and North American markets. And cut flowers have a limited life. Workers must treat them with great care. They control the temperature and air quality around the flowers. The flowers must reach their market quickly. If this does not happen they will be ruined or die. So flower farmers use airplanes to fly their flowers to market. Jane Ngige is the Chief Executive of the Kenyan Flower Council. She told CNN that being able to fly flowers to their market is very important.\u2018A direct flight to the market is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to promise quality.\u2019However, flying flowers around the world uses a lot of energy. This produces carbon. Some people may be concerned that this is not good for the environment and climate change. But others are not worried. Hilary Benn was the United Kingdom\u2019s International Development Secretary. In 2013\u00a0he told a conference that flying flowers around the world used less energy than growing flowers in Europe.\u2018People often do not understand that they can support developing countries and reduce the release of carbon. Recent research shows that flowers flown from Africa can use less energy overall than those produced in Europe. This is because they are not grown in heated glass houses.\u2019Some people raised another concern about flowers produced in developing countries. In some places there were problems for flower workers. They worked in poor conditions. Sometimes they worked long hours with no rest periods. They were paid low wages. Farmers did not protect workers from chemicals used. However in recent years working conditions have improved on flower farms in many countries. And hundreds of flower farms have become farms.Fair trade organisations decide if a farm meets the fair trade quality. On fair trade farms workers receive better wages. And they have safe working conditions. Fair trade flowers cost buyers about\u00a010%\u00a0more money. This extra money is called the \u2018social premium\u2019. It is controlled by groups of local workers.The workers use the social premium money to pay for community projects. Each local project is different. But all improve quality of life. Education projects provide equipment, classes and toilets for schools. Parents get help to pay the cost of sending their children to school and university. Carlota Garcia works on a flower farm in Ecuador. She told the organisation Fair Trade USA how she was helped,\u2018Thanks to this programme, I was able to keep my children in school and give them everything they need to study: clothes, joining costs, school supplies.\u2019Other social premium projects help workers buy their homes. Health projects prevent diseases such as malaria and cholera. Environmental projects include green energy and tree planting. Samuel Atieno lives near the Athi River in Kenya. He led one social premium workers group. He told the organisation Fairtrade Foundation of his experience and big hopes for the future,\u2018Fair trade is a life changer. If this premium money can change the life of a worker in such a short time; if it can turn around the life of a family, of a community; then can\u2019t this premium also change the structure of the country? In the long run we will affect Kenya and then even Africa.\u2019Do you buy flowers? Would you buy fair trade flowers? What do you think about flying flowers around the world?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In 2007, Ryan Hall was running the Houston half marathon. The race is a little longer than 13 miles. Hall was having a great race. He was running each mile in about 4:20. He was even winning the race. But with only a few miles left, Hall felt his stomach tense and become very painful. This can happen during long, difficult exercise. It feels like there is a rock in your stomach.Hall is a Christian believer. So he decided to  \u2013 to talk to God. This is something he does every day. He talks to God about his hopes and fears. He talks to God about good things for his family. He talks to God about different ways to make the world a better place. So Hall decided to pray about this too. He told Outside Magazine that he prayed,\u201cLord, please help me get to the finish line without my stomach stopping me.\u201dHe repeated this prayer for about a minute. Then the feeling in his stomach went away. He was able to continue to run. He even went on to win the race. In fact, he had one of the best races of his life. Hall says it was because of the power of prayer. Hall had trained for years as a runner, but the prayer seemed to give him something extra. But what was it? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the power of prayer in sport.The human brain produces different signals depending on how the brain is working. These signals are called brainwaves. Scientists can measure these waves in a laboratory. Scientists can look at brainwaves and know if a person is sleeping or if they are thinking about a difficult problem.When a person is competing well in sport, their brain makes alpha brainwaves. The brain makes alpha waves when a person is calm and focused. They are not thinking too much. Many athletes call this being in \u201cthe zone\u201d or \u201cflow.\u201d They report being able to perform their sport and not think too much about what they should do. They just act.But it is difficult for a person to force their brain to make alpha waves. Playing a sport is not something that is always calm and relaxed. There is a lot of pressure to perform well. Athletes try to find ways to be calm and focused. They often use a process called visualization.Visualization happens when athletes think about what they\u00a0\u00a0to happen. Before they compete, they imagine how they will achieve their goal. They imagine a perfect performance. They imagine all the details. This helps them prepare for their sport. Visualization is similar to prayer in some ways. Both things happen in a person\u2019s mind and claim to change the physical world.Andrew Newberg is a Neuroscientist. He studies the effect of religious acts like praying, on the human brain. He believes that prayer is more powerful than visualization.Newberg\u2019s research shows that religious people are doing more than visualization. They\u00a0\u00a0what they are doing. This makes prayer stronger than visualization. Newberg told Outside Magazine,\u201cThe more you believe in whatever you are doing, the stronger the effect is going to be. If you are a religious person and your religion is important to you, then being able to pray can be very valuable.\u201dThis means that when people like Ryan Hall have very strong beliefs, their prayers in sport can help them. But while many people pray that they win their sport, there is more to prayer than winning. Being a Christian believer is not all about winning.The Christian Bible says that when people follow the example of Jesus, their life will be full of love, joy, and peace. They will be patient, kind, and good. They will be faithful, gentle, and self-controlled. Reid S. Monaghan wrote for the organization Athletes in Action. He wrote about how when Christians pray during sports, they can pray about more than winning. He wrote,\u201cWe can be a very superstitious group as athletes. We think that if we do the right things before a game that things are going to go well in the game. There is some truth in this. Doing the same thing before every game helps us focus, calm the mind and prepare the body. Yet it is dangerous as Christians to mix God up into sport as if we are using him to make us win. Some of us pray before practices and games almost as if God will give us good luck if we do so \u2013 as if God is a lucky charm and our prayers will make us win. God is not our good luck charm.\u201dMonaghan says that we should not see prayer as all about us. Prayer is about other people too. He wrote,\u201cMany times during games we can forget that God is working in the lives of many people. During the game, what if you prayed for a struggling friend or someone whose anger is stopping them from their best play? What if we could move away from prayers only for us and learn to love God by thinking about other people? That would be a big change.\u201dAthletes who are followers of Jesus say that Christian prayer is not just a trick to be better at sport. It is a way to talk to God. In fact, for athletes like Ryan Hall, being a Christian athlete is not mostly about winning or losing. It is about living how God wants him to live. In an interview with Runner\u2019s World Magazine, Hall said,\u201cI believe that the Bible unlocks the perfect heart for athletes to compete from. The most important thing I can train is my heart. It is what drives the body. Christians should be able to compete with more freedom, less pressure and more joy. I have become better at being OK with whatever God has for me in a race.\u201dDo you think prayer can help people? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Two people stand next to each other at the bottom of a tall wall. The wall is 15 metres high. On the wall are rocks. They are not real rocks, but colourful plastic shaped to look like rocks. The plastic rocks are placed at different spaces and positions to create a route, or path, up the wall. So each person has the same choices about where to put their feet and hands. Two climbers place their hands on the wall. They tense their bodies. They wait.When they get the signal to go, they race up the wall as fast as they can. They move so quickly they look as if they are running up the wall. When they reach the top, they hit a button with their hand. This marks their time. There is a rope that catches them and brings them slowly back to the ground. This is the sport of speed climbing. These races are only six or seven seconds long. This makes speed climbing the fastest sport in the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on speed climbing \u2013 a new Olympic sport for 2020.In 2020, the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Sports and events change at every Olympics. The 2020 games will add the sports of skateboarding, baseball and softball, karate, surfing, and climbing events.Sports are added through a complex process. Olympics officials consider global popularity, cultural diversity, and if there are organizations that can help set the rules. But two other important goals are to reach younger people and to create an equal opportunity for men and women to perform in the games. With these new sports, especially surfing and climbing, officials hope to achieve these goals.Officials chose climbing because it has become more and more popular around the world. When you hear the word climbing, you may think of climbing a mountain. People have been climbing mountains for thousands of years. They climb to travel and explore and to have fun. But speed climbing is a little different.Speed climbing does not happen on a mountain. It happens on a wall made by people. It usually happens inside a building. And this sport is becoming more and more popular. The International Federation of Sport Climbing, or IFSC, says that more than 140 countries have speed climbing walls. And 35 million climbers do this sport worldwide.The IFSC makes exact rules for this new sport. They also designed the route. Every speed climbing route is the same all over the world, so everyone climbs the same path. Each route is either ten meters or 15 meters high. Brendan Blanchard is a climber who wrote about speed climbing for Climbing Magazine. He explained the sport like this,\u201cThe rules for the official IFSC speed climbing are simple. Climbers compete on the same path, side by side. The first to the top wins. Times are recorded by a device under the climber\u2019s foot at the base of the path, and a sensor at the top. The path is always the same. Everyone can train on the same path at any climbing gym that has a speed wall.\u201dSpeed climbing is not for everyone. Many people like to be on a real mountain. Other people do not want the risks of climbing so fast. But many people see it as a new challenge. They compare it to running up a wall! Top speed climbers come from places all over the world, like Spain, Italy, and China. Reza Alipour holds the world record for the 15 metre wall climb. He comes from the country of Iran. He climbed the 15 meter wall in only 5.48 seconds. He is so fast that people sometimes call him Persian Cheetah \u2014 the fastest animal in the world.Many athletes welcome the choice to include climbing in the next Olympics. They are excited to finally get a chance to compete at one of the world\u2019s largest events. They will get to show the world how climbing is a fun and exciting sport. But they will also get to show what amazing athletes they are. They hope that this encourages more people to try climbing.But the excitement about climbing at the Olympics is not just among people who may get to climb in the games. Many people also like to watch speed climbing. Mark Glennie directs the British national climbing team. He told The Guardian that,\u201cMore people know about the sport. And it clearly works as a sport people enjoy to watch. It is very like the sport of gymnastics. It is very exciting. But, it is also very easy to understand as a normal person.\u201dBut not everyone thinks that speed climbing is a good thing. For many people who climb, climbing is more like a way of life than a sport. It is about more than speed or competition. It is about being on a rock or a mountain and giving yourself a challenge. Alex Honnold is one of the greatest free climbers in the world. Free climbers climb mountains without using ropes or other protection. Honnold\u2019s climbs often take him hundreds of metres up a mountain with nothing to stop him from falling but his own hands. Would he consider taking part in speed climbing events? He told David Ferry of Outside Magazine that he would not be anywhere near the Japan Olympics.\u201cI would not even be able to qualify for these climbing events. Competitive climbing is basically a whole different sport.\u201dFerry argues that the Olympics wants to attract young people, but they are doing it in the wrong way. He writes,\u201cYoung climbers do not want to watch the world\u2019s best climbers climb on plastic rocks. They want to see climbers pulling hard on La Dura Dura, one of the most difficult sport routes in the world.\u201dHave you ever climbed? Would you like to try speed climbing?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Yoshiyuki  loves to design and create clothes. He is a successful clothes designer. As a young boy he wanted the clothes that he saw in stores, but they cost too much money. So he began to make his own clothes. When he was a university student, Miyamae was able to attend a clothing show by another Japanese designer, Issey Miyake. He saw how clothes could change how people felt. He explained to the Thailand Tatler,\u201cHow does what we wear influence how we feel? When we wear bright colours, we are in a bright mood. When we feel tired, we do not want to wear clothes that fit close to our body. To me, this is the power of clothes.\u201dClothes can simply protect us from rain, cold, or heat. But clothes can also change how people see us. They can change how we see ourselves. Clothes can even be a way to express our personality. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the power of clothes.If someone told you, \u201cYou look nice today!\u201d what would you imagine you are wearing? A colourful dress? A shirt and necktie? Maybe your favorite shirt or shoes? The answer depends on where you live. Clothes are different around the world. Also, there are different clothes for different situations or events.The clothes we wear communicate something. Some people like clothes that are wild and crazy. Other people like clothes that are quiet and simple. Each choice tells the world something. Clothes shape us in ways we may not even understand. For example, in school, many children all wear the same uniforms. Research shows that children who wear uniforms learn better in school. When people wear clothes for exercise, they are more likely to exercise. Even the color of our clothes can change how we feel. Gauri Sarda-Joshi wrote for Brain Fodder about this. She wrote,\u201cWhile our mental state clearly affects the way we dress; the opposite may also be true. What we wear could affect how we react when we are sad, nervous, or feeling stress. Research says the fastest little fix for a bad day is to wear brightly colored clothes. Happy colors can improve how we feel and how much energy we have. We connect bright colors with happiness, days in the sun, and carefree times like the summer vacations when we were children.\u201dOur clothes can even change the way we think. In 2015, the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science published a study. The study looked at how students felt wearing different kinds of clothes. Formal clothing is clothing a person may wear to work or an important event. The study found that when the students dressed in formal clothing they were better at thinking about complex problems.Many jobs used to require people to wear  clothing. This could be a suit and tie for a man and a dress for women. But now this is less common. People dress more in casual clothes \u2014 clothes that are more comfortable. But this does not mean formal clothing is going away. Michael Slepian is one of the authors of the study. He told the Atlantic,\u201cI would even guess the effect this study found could get stronger if formal clothing is only worn for the most formal of situations. It takes a long time for symbols and our agreed meaning of those symbols to change. I would not expect formal clothes as the symbol of power to be leaving us anytime soon.\u201dAnd it is not just formal clothing that can have power. Scarlett Curtis was only 14 years old when she needed a medical surgery. After the surgery, she was only able to walk short distances. She stayed at home. She often stayed in bed. She only dressed in soft, comfortable clothes that were easy to sleep in. But Curtis decided to go to school in New York City and make a change. She still found clothes that made her feel comfortable. But now her clothes also helped her feel better. She began to choose clothes would look nice too. She wrote in InStyle magazine,\u201cIt is easy to think of clothes as things that only touch the surface. We forget the truth that every choice we make each morning says something about who we are or who we want to be. Our clothes are the protection we put on against the battle that is life. As I move back into normal life I struggle with this; the strong connection between how I feel and what I am wearing.\u201dAnd yet, not everyone in the world is able to make these choices so easily. Many people do not have a lot of clothes. And in some places this becomes a problem.In Myanmar there has been a lot of fighting between different groups. One result of this has been that over 100,000 people had to leave their homes in one area \u2013 Kachin State. Many of these people live in refugee camps. They do not have money or stores to buy clothes. The Japanese clothing company UNIQLO decided to work with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to do something.UNIQLO gave clothing from Japan to the refugees in Myanmar. One woman who left her home in Myanmar explained to the UNHCR why this was important:\u201cSome of us even had no choice than to leave by foot. We heard the gun shots and we escaped. We could carry one or two sets of clothes. What we are wearing is what we brought from home. When we left we took some things with us, but not a lot. We did not think it would take so long before we could return to our villages.\u201dEven in a bad situation, good clothes can make people feel a little better. People living in refugee camps do not care about the latest trends in fashion. They want new, clean clothes. It does not solve all their problems. But it does help them feel better.What about you?

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It was the night before Christmas, When all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.That is the beginning of a famous Christmas poem. It is called A Visit from Saint Nicholas, by Clement C. Moore. The poem describes a house on the night before Christmas. Nothing is moving, not even a small brown mouse. The family has hung stockings by the fire. Usually, they wear these stockings on their feet. But tonight, they hope that Saint Nicholas will come and fill their stockings with sweet treats and gifts. The poem continues, and tells a story about a father who sees Saint Nicholas bring these gifts to his house during the night.Many countries around the world have stories about Saint Nicholas. The stories are based on a real man called Saint Nicholas. Over time the details of the stories change. They are no longer real stories from history. But the stories explain different Christmas traditions. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the many Christmas stories about Saint Nicholas.The real Saint Nicholas was born during the third century in a village near Myra, which is now in Turkey. His parents were very devoted followers of Jesus. And they raised their son to be a follower of Jesus too. When Nicholas was young, his parents died from disease. But he remembered the values his parents taught him.As an adult, Nicholas remembered one particular teaching from the Christian Bible. It was to care for poor and sick people. In the Christian Bible, Jesus tells his followers to sell their things and give to the poor. Nicholas could not forget these words. He gave away lots of his money to the poor. And he helped people who were sick or suffering. There are many stories about his secret giving. It is not clear if these stories are true. But they show how much he cared for poor people. Nick Page tells one version of one of the most famous stories.A father had three daughters. At that time, there was a custom for marriage \u2013 a dowry. The father offered a gift to the man who wanted to marry his daughter. Without this gift, it was not likely for a woman to find a husband. But the father was very poor. He did not have enough money for this custom. So he planned to sell one of his daughters. He thought if he did this he would be able to care for his other daughters.Nicholas heard about the father\u2019s problem. He went to the father\u2019s house the night before the daughter was going to be sold. The daughter had washed her stockings and hung them by the fire to dry. Nicholas threw a small bag of gold into one of the stockings. Then he left. In the morning, the man discovered the gold. Now he did not need to sell his daughter. Instead he was able to find a husband for his daughter. In a year, it was time for his next daughter to be married. But the man was still poor. Once again, Nicholas came during the night. And again, he threw a bag of gold into a stocking.Finally, when it was time for his third daughter to marry, the man waited. He wanted to know who was giving the gifts. For a final time, a bag of gold came through his window. This time, the man was ready. He ran out of the house and the person he saw was Nicholas. But Nicholas demanded that the man keep this knowledge a secret.Over time, Nicholas became well-known for his kind, generous giving. People also knew that he was a follower of Jesus. He even became a bishop \u2014 a religious leader \u2014 of the city of Myra. As a bishop, Nicholas continued to serve poor, sick, and suffering people. Years after he died, people wanted to honor him for devoting his life to God and caring for people. So they named him a saint.Many countries have created stories about Saint Nicholas as a secret gift-giver. Often the stories are for children. Saint Nicholas considers how children have behaved all year. Then, he gives them good  for good behaviour and bad gifts for bad behaviour. These stories explain Christmas traditions. For example, in many European countries, children leave their shoes out for Saint Nicholas. They hope he will fill their shoes with treats.There are also other stories about Saint Nicholas. In Greece, he is not a secret gift-giver. Instead, he is the saint who protects sailors. It is said that in bad weather, sailors would pray to Saint Nicholas. Then he would appear to them like a dream. He would guide them to safety and could make the storms go away.It is not clear exactly when Saint Nicholas died. But many people believe that he died in the year 343 A.D. He was then buried in the city of Myra. Because of his goodness, many religious people travelled to the place he was buried. But during the 11th century, there was war in the area of Myra. A group of sailors used the war as a chance to steal the bones of Saint Nicholas. They brought them to Bari, Italy. That is where Saint Nicholas is buried today.If you believe the stories, Saint Nicholas is the Christmas saint. In many European countries, he is called Saint Nicholas. In Italy he is San Nicola. In the Netherlands they call him Sinterklaas. In the United States, he is Santa Claus. And in Britain, he is Father Christmas. He has many names, but the idea of the person is the same. He is a gift-giver who brings good cheer at Christmas time.But Saint Nicholas believed in a very different kind of Christmas gift. Christians like Saint Nicholas celebrate Christmas as a time to remember Jesus\u2019 birth. Christians believe that Jesus was a gift to the world. They believe he was both God and human. And because Jesus lived as a human, he knows what it is like to have pain and hurt, joys and happiness. Christians believe that in Jesus\u2019 birth, God comes to earth. God brought the gift of hope to a broken world.Does your culture celebrate a Christmas Saint? What stories have you heard about Saint Nicholas? You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.There is an ancient story told in Thailand. It happened in the 1700s. The story is set in the kingdom of Burma, which is now the country of Myanmar. At that time, Burma had defeated Thailand in a war. There were many Thai prisoners in Burma. The king of Burma decided to have a celebration. One event was a boxing competition. The king and other people watched. Burmese fighters fought against the Thai prisoners. There was one Thai fighter who beat everyone else. He even beat the best boxing teacher in Burma. His name was Nai Khanomtom. The King of Burma had a high opinion of Nai Khanomtom. He gave Khanomtom a very good prize. The king released him from prison. Khanomtom was free to move back to Thailand.Today, a similar thing is happening in Thailand. Siriporn Thaveesuk went to prison when she was only 17. Soon, she joined a boxing program. Three years later Thaveesuk won an international . And, like Nai Khanomtom, she won her freedom from prison.Thaveesuk is one of many prisoners in Thailand who are training to be boxers. If they win, they will be closer to freedom. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Thai prisoners who improve their lives and gain their freedom through boxing.Thai boxing is also called Muay Thai. Two Muay Thai fighters stand together in a square shaped fighting area. They wear short trousers but no shirts. Each of their hands and wrists are tightly wrapped with white rope. When the fight begins the fighters use their hands, elbows, knees and feet to hit each other. People cheer for the fighters. Muay Thai is a popular form of entertainment in Thailand.Prisons in Thailand are using this form of entertainment for a new purpose. The Thai government began a program for boxing in prisons. Prisoners all around the country compete in Muay Thai fights. This provides entertainment but it also gives the prisoners something to do.Muay Thai is a very difficult sport. Fighters must be very strong. They must live a very healthy life. They spend many hours training their bodies. They also train their minds. They spend hours meditating and breathing. This training is helpful for prisoners. It is healthier than other activities such as smoking cigarettes or taking illegal drugs. Aree Chaloisuk is the director of Klong Pai prison. He tells Hemispheres magazine about the advantages of the program for the prisoners:\u201cMuay Thai is a strong part of Thai culture. I think the fighters are proud to take part in the program. From what I have seen, it can improve bad behaviour. It provides a chance for a job for prisoners after they leave prison. They can compete instead of becoming criminals again.\u201dPrisoners also train and fight for another reason. If they win their fights, they can reduce the time they have to stay in prison. Like in the story of Nai Khanomtom, prisoners can win their freedom through Muay Thai. One man working to do this is Chalernpol Sawangsuk. He is 26 years old. He is in prison for selling illegal drugs. But since he started practicing Muay Thai in prison, his life is different. Sawangsuk told Hemispheres magazine:\u201cIt was a big change to my life. I think the program has helped me to concentrate. I have slowed down. I think about things more. I am more reasonable. I have seen myself grow up. The other life, I think it is really behind me.\u201dSawangsuk has won five fights. Through these, he has reduced his prison time by seven years. There are other prisoners who have been completely set free from prison. One of these is Amnat Ruenroeng. He is now on Thailand\u2019s Olympic boxing team. Winning a place on the national boxing team is a dream for all of the fighters. It is a great chance to bring honor to their country.An organization called Prison Fight works with the Muay Thai prison program. Their aim was to help prisoners reduce prison time. Today, they help by providing equipment to the Thai prisoners. Prison Fight also organizes local and international events with the Thai government. They believe it is also a good way to share Thai culture. So prisoners in Thailand sometimes fight people from other countries. One international Prison Fight event took place in January 2013. Thai prisoners fought against fighters from France, Myanmar, and other countries. The event was a great success. Saichon Somnet is the head coach at Klong Prem prison. He talks in a video about the event:\u201cToday makes me happy and gives me a chance to share Muay Thai with people outside our country. It is very difficult for prisoners to get this kind of chance. I am very happy it is happening today.\u201dThere are good results for the rest of Thai society too. The Thai government says that none of the released boxers have ever been arrested for another crime. They hope that Muay Thai keeps people from doing illegal activities. It also gives prisoners new skills and chances for the future. Wanchai Roujanavong is the director general of Thailand\u2019s Department of Corrections. He told TIME magazine:\u201cPeople in prison have a lot of time. It is a good environment for dedicating yourself to boxing. The sport also provides new chances after prison. A lot of people have a difficult time finding jobs after they are released. But in boxing, no one cares about your history.\u201dSome prisoners have even found that fighting gives them new hope. It even helps them fix past mistakes. A boxer named Black Lion has fought in many Muay Thai fights in prison. He tells TIME magazine that he hopes to improve himself and his relationships. Black Lion voices the hope of many prisoners:\u201cI have made my mother sad for so long. I only finished first grade. I took drugs. Maybe with boxing and good concentration, I can fix myself and make my mother proud.\u201dThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In March of 2018, many people in London, England, received some troubling letters. People in other communities, like Birmingham, and Leicester, got these letters too. These letters were encouraging people to take part in an event. This event was called \u201cPunish a Muslim Day\u201d. The letter told people to do acts of violence against Muslims. The person who wrote the letters wanted to get lots of people to join.The Muslim community in England was very upset by these letters. Tell MAMA is a group based in England. They support victims of anti-Muslim hate. Iman Atta was the director of Tell MAMA. She told Sky News,\u201cThis has caused quite a lot of fear within the community. People are asking if they are safe. They are asking if their children are safe to play outdoors.\u201dThese letters made people afraid. It was probably easier to not talk about them. In many situations people do not talk about hate crimes. But there are ways to fight hate.Today\u2019s Spotlight program is the second in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we look at ten ways to fight hate.Hate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate in your community. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the second way to fight hate in your community: Join Forces.Manzoor Ali was a resident of Manchester and a Muslim. He owned a cafe in Manchester, England. When he heard of these letters, he was hurt. He decided to do something. His family planned a different day. The day they planned was called \u201cBanish Hate Day.\u201d On this day, he encouraged people to be kind. His shop gave away free tea, cake and other treats. Ali told The Manchester Evening News:\u201cWe will not let small-minded people set us against each other. Instead, our arms and doors are open \u2013 even to those minds that incite hate. Get to know us, and our community. Join us in our community work. Use that negative energy to do good.\u201dShahab Adris heard of these letters too. He wrote another letter. But this letter encouraged people to participate in \u201cLove a Muslim Day.\u201d He encouraged people to support Muslims instead of hurting them. He suggested that people could take Muslim friends to get coffee. Or invite a Muslim friend over to hang out.Muslims and non-Muslims responded to his letter. They said they would join. They created community events where people could come together and celebrate \u201cLove a Muslim Day.\u201d Adris told the Huffington Post:\u201cIn the face of extreme hatred, it is important to stay positive. And show some creativity. We must rise above it. We must be active and show compassion and love to our fellow citizens.\u201dSometimes bringing people together is a difficult job. People who experience hate often feel afraid or alone. People who want to fight against hate may not know how to start. The Southern Poverty Law Center says that people should always remember one thing. People around you also want to stop hate. That is why it is so important to unite and join forces.Everyone knows that there is power in numbers. Many people have a louder voice than only one person. More people can do more things. They can educate more people. Criminals may also be less likely to attack a larger group of people. And more people also means more ideas! Every person can add something. So how can you join forces? How can you find people to connect to?The SPLC says that there are many ways to join forces with other people. You can start by joining with people who you are already close to. Gather with your friends and family. Ask the people who live near you, your neighbours, to join your group against hate. Invite the people you work or worship with.Remember also to join with people who are different to you. Uniting can bring together every person of a community. When you see hate, encourage your group to act against it. Meet together and talk about ways to make your group grow. Talk about ways to educate your community about people who are different.You can also work with larger groups in your community. What groups in your community might want to stop hate? The SPLC suggests inviting and involving women\u2019s groups, teachers, labour unions, university workers, and young people groups. Involve schools, businesses, places of worship, children, members of minority groups and politicians. They also encourage people to involve local police. Police can watch for early signs of hate in a community.That is what people in London did when those letters arrived. These letters encouraged people to hurt each other. They wanted to divide people. But the people in these communities did not divide. The police departments encouraged people to turn in the letters if they received them. The police went out to find who sent the letters. Angela Williams, from the West Yorkshire police, told these communities:\u201cOur communities should be careful. But do not be frightened. We are stronger when we stand together as one and will not be divided.\u201dAnd the community did stand together. In response, people like Manzoor Ali and Shahab Adris joined forces. Some people posted on social media. They made a hashtag: #WeStandTogether. They volunteered to walk people home from work or school. Some people made leaflets and online posts about what to do if you see a hate crime.Sadly, hate exists in every community. But there are many ways that people can stand up and join forces against it. Remember that you are not alone.This is the second program in a series of . This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center is a group that works toward racial justice, especially in the Southern United States. They monitor hate crimes, teach tolerance, and seek justice. Here are their 10 ways to fight hate., Join Forces, , , Educate Yourself, Create An Alternative, Pressure Leaders, Stay Engaged, Teach Acceptance, and Dig Deeper.Keep listening to Spotlight to hear the complete series.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In today\u2019s Spotlight we tell a famous story. In fact, it may be the most famous story in history! This is the Christmas Story. It is about the birth of a special baby. The story begins 2,000 years ago in the small town of Nazareth in ancient Israel.At that time, a man named Caesar Augustus was the leader of the Roman Kingdom. Augustus wanted officials to count each person of his kingdom. So he ordered a census. Each family in the kingdom had to return to its home town. A man named Joseph lived in the town of Nazareth. Joseph was engaged to a woman named Mary. Soon, they would be married. Joseph\u2019s family was from the town of Bethlehem. So Joseph and Mary had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem.This trip from Nazareth to Bethlehem was long. And Mary was very pregnant. She would have a baby very soon. So Mary and Joseph had to travel slowly. As they travelled, Mary remembered a time before she was pregnant. One day about a year ago, an angel had visited her. This messenger of God called himself Gabriel. Gabriel said:\u201cMary! You are truly blessed. God is with you.\u201dMary was surprised and frightened. But the angel said:\u201cDo not be afraid! God is very pleased with you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus. He will be great and people will call him the Son of the Most High God. The Lord God will make him a king. He will rule forever over his people. His Kingdom will never end.\u201dMary was engaged to Joseph. But she was not married. They had never had sex. Mary wondered how she would become pregnant. But the angel said:\u201cGod\u2019s Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come over you. Because of this, the child will be holy. People will call him the Son of God.\u201dMary answered the angel simply.\u201cI serve the Lord. May it happen to me just as you said it would.\u201dNow Mary was pregnant, and travelling to Bethlehem. After almost a week, they finally arrived.Joseph began to look for a place to stay. He asked a man in a house nearby.\u201cI am Joseph. This is Mary. We are in Bethlehem to be counted in the census. And we are looking for a place to rest for the night. Can we stay here, in one of your empty rooms?\u201dThe man told him:\u201cNo, we have no room for visitors.\u201dJoseph continued to ask for a room at many houses. But no one had any room for the tired couple. Finally, one man told them:\u201cI see that the woman is very pregnant. We do not have any room inside the house. However, you can stay outside in our stable. It is not a comfortable room. This is where our animals stay. But, it will be a shelter and you can find some soft straw to lie on.\u201dJoseph and Mary agreed to stay in the man\u2019s stable. In one corner there was a small manger. The manger held hay, a kind of grass, for the animals to eat. While Mary and Joseph were there, the time came for Mary\u2019s baby to be born.\u201cJoseph it\u2019s time! This baby will be born tonight!\u201d\u201cAre you sure?!\u201d\u201cYes! Hurry! I am sure tonight will be the night!\u00a0It was late at night. The stars shined brightly over the stable. Finally, Mary\u2019s baby was born. Mary praised God for the gift of a healthy baby. She tied cloth around him to keep him warm. There was no place to lay him, so Mary laid him in the manger. The soft hay grass was the baby\u2019s bed. Joseph and Mary named the baby Jesus.On the same night, in a different part of Bethlehem there was a group of shepherds. They were watching their flocks of sheep. The shepherds settled down for the night. While some of the shepherds slept, others stayed awake to watch the sheep. Suddenly, a heavenly angel appeared in the sky. God\u2019s light shined all around them. The shepherds were extremely frightened.\u201cWhat is that!?\u201d\u201cI have never seen anything like that before!\u201d\u201cHide!\u201d\u201cNo, stay here, the angel is about to speak!\u201d\u201cDo not be afraid! I am here to  a great and joyful event. This event will bless all people around the world. A savior has just been born in Bethlehem. The savior will be the Messiah and King. Go and look for him. This is what you will look for: a baby wrapped in a blanket and lying in a manger.Immediately, a large crowd of angels appeared. The angels sang \u201cGlory to God in the heavenly heights, Peace to all men and women on earth who please him!\u201d The shepherds were amazed by the angels.When the angels left them, they began to talk.\u201cWe must go to Bethlehem!\u201d\u201cYes! We need to see this savior who has been born!\u201dSo the shepherds left their sheep. They began running toward Bethlehem to find the new baby. They searched everywhere. Finally, they found Mary and Joseph. They found the baby, Jesus, wrapped in cloth and lying in the manger. They fell to their knees to worship the newly born baby.As the shepherds left, they praised God. They told everyone they met about what the angels had said about the baby. Everyone who heard their story was amazed.In the small stable, Mary comforted her new baby. She held him close. She would remember this special night through her whole life.This is the amazing story of Jesus\u2019 birth. Every year at Christmas, Christians celebrate this event. They tell this story. Children and adults perform the story in plays. They tell it again and again to remember why they celebrate the holiday of Christmas.But, Christians know that the Christmas story is only the beginning of a larger story. When Jesus grew up, he was a great teacher. He lived a perfect life. And he did many miracles. Jesus was not just any man. Jesus was God\u2019s son. He was born on earth to save people from their sins \u2013 all the wrong things they do. This is the miracle Christians celebrate at Christmas. Jesus, God\u2019s son, came down to earth as a weak and helpless baby. But, just as the angels said, he would sacrifice himself for all people, around the world. That is the true meaning of the Christmas story.This telling of the Christmas story is based on Luke chapter 2. You can find our programs on the internet at www.radioenglish.net.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is Holy Week in Cuenca, a city in Ecuador. During this week, people prepare for the Christian holidays of Good Friday and Easter. Many people go to church. People who are very traditional even go to seven different churches in one day! People also prepare special food. They especially make fanesca. It is a tasty, thick soup, served in a round bowl. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on fanesca.There are many good foods in Ecuador, but fanesca is a special holiday food. It represents many different traditions and symbols. Cooking and eating fanesca is often a family tradition. Jessi Franco is from Ecuador. He shared his thoughts on fanesca with Spotlight:\u201cMy mom used to prepare the fanesca, but now she is too old. My older sister also knows how to prepare it. It is  with all the ingredients and quantities. I hope my sister prepares the fanesca this year and invites me!\u201dPeople in Ecuador only eat fanesca during Holy Week. Holy Week is the week before the Christian holiday of Easter. It is the most important holiday for many Christians. This celebration happens every year in March or April. Easter is a time when Christians remember Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection.Jesus\u2019 story comes from the Christian Bible. Jesus lived on earth more than 2,000 years ago. But the Christian Bible says that Jesus was not just a man. He was also God. He taught people about the love and peace of God. The authorities killed Jesus. But the Christian Bible teaches that, three days later, he rose again from the dead. In this way Jesus overcame sin and death.During Holy Week people remember the suffering that Jesus experienced when he was killed. Then at the end of this week, they celebrate his resurrection with the joyful holiday of Easter. It is a day of celebrating with traditional events and special food. People are full of happiness because they remember the new life that God gave them.Christians around the world have different traditions during Holy Week. Fanesca is one of these traditions. Fanesca is a kind of soup. It is made with many different foods. People use many different kinds of vegetables, such as sweet orange squash and corn. They also use many kinds of grains, like rice. And fanesca is famous for having many beans in it. These small seed-like foods are very healthy. Many kinds of beans grow in Ecuador.To cook fanesca, people must first cook all the vegetables, grains and beans. They prepare each of these one at a time. They also prepare special fish called salt cod. Then, they mix everything together. They add milk to make the soup into a thick liquid. And at the end, people add the fish to the soup along with eggs and plantain bananas.Marcelo Gudino is a Spotlight listener. He says:\u201cThe fanesca soup is one of my favourite dishes. In Ecuador it is an old tradition to eat this food. We join with the family and everyone helps in some task. It takes a lot of work to make this soup. Finally all together we give thanks to God and enjoy it!\u201dMaking fanesca takes a lot of work and preparation. But preparing fanesca can be a fun family event. All the members of a family will join together to help make the soup. Each person has a job. One person may help by taking the corn off of the corn cob. Another person may take the skin off of the potatoes. Others may cut vegetables or cook the food.Layla Pujol has a website about Ecuadorian food. She now lives in the United States. But she says that preparing fanesca is a very important custom for her family. On her blog \u2018Laylita\u2019s Recipes\u2019 she says:\u201cAs a child, I experienced all the local customs around Easter and helped prepare fanesca. Usually, the children had the job of peeling all the fresh beans and grains. I try to do the same with my children now. I want to make sure that they understand the real meaning of this holiday. I want them to learn about the customs that I grew up with in Ecuador. I have found that food is a great way to teach children about traditions and customs, especially if you involve them in the preparation of the food.\u201dAfter the hard work of preparing the soup, everyone enjoys eating it together. People think fanesca tastes great! But for some people it is also part of the spiritual preparations for the Easter holiday. For the 40 days before Easter, some Ecuadorians do not eat any meat except fish. They do this to remember the suffering of Jesus. So fanesca is made with fish as a part of the fast before Easter.Some people also say that the fish has a symbolic meaning \u2013 it is an ancient symbol for Christ. The fish stands for the name \u2018Jesus Christ, God\u2019s Son, Saviour.\u2019 Many people think that the grains and beans are also symbolic. Some people add exactly 12 different grains to their fanesca. Some Christians believe that these twelve grains represent the twelve disciples, or followers, of Jesus.Holy Week is also around the time that farmers harvest many crops. This may be another reason why people eat fanesca at this time. During harvest season poor people would gather many grains and beans. They made fanesca because it is a very filling and healthy soup. The thick soup would fill people\u2019s stomachs until they felt full. The people would then give thanks to God for providing for them.These stories about fanesca are part of Ecuadorian tradition. In Ecuador, there are many traditions and cultures. They mix together, the same way fanesca is full of many different foods. Mixed together it tastes good and is very special. When people eat fanesca during Holy Week, they give thanks to God for all the many different but good things he gives us.The writers of this program were Rebekah Schipper and Rena Dam.

I\u2019m Katy Blake.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u2018Let me put the sheep in.\u2019\u2018I want to put the wise men in.\u2019\u2018Can I put the baby in?\u2019These children are not just playing. They are making something together. It is something they build every year. It helps them remember an important event. Many people around the world build something like this every year at Christmas. It is a Nativity scene.At Christmastime they remember the story of the birth of one special baby, Jesus. He was born over 2000 years ago in a small town called Bethlehem. He was born in a stable, the place where animals were kept. The animals ate from a manger, or animal feed box. The baby used a manger as his crib or bed. Shepherds with their sheep visited him. And wise men from the East brought him gifts.All of these things are included in this model of the night of Jesus\u2019 birth. The Nativity scene contains small figures or statues of the baby Jesus, Mary his mother, and her husband Joseph. Figures of the animals and those who visited the baby are also included. People put nativity scenes in their homes to remember Jesus\u2019 birth. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on nativity scenes.Naples, in Italy, is a city that is famous for making nativity scenes. The people of that city have used nativity scenes in churches for almost a thousand years. The nativity scenes from Naples are very special. Sometimes people build them in the shape of a tall triangle with a star at the top. A star guided the wise men from the East to Jesus. The nativity scenes always include Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus. But they also have lots of extra every-day people and objects. The largest nativity scene in the world is in Naples. It has 162 people, 80 animals, angels and about 450 smaller objects.Nativity scenes are also very important in the country of Malta. Maltese people first built them in the 17th century. An organisation called the \u2018Friends of the Crib\u2019 was formed in Malta in 1986. It has over 500 members. In the weeks before Christmas the Friends organise a show of about 100 nativity scenes. They are in all shapes and sizes. Some even contain mechanical figures that move.In some countries the figures in nativity scenes move for a different reason. They move because they are alive! They are part of living nativity scenes. In Spain many towns create these living nativity scenes. Local people dress up as people from the story of Jesus\u2019 birth. They act different parts of the story. The main nativity scene is always the birth of the baby Jesus.Living nativity scenes are also popular in Italy. In both countries some living nativity scenes are simple and basic. In other towns living nativity scenes are larger. Several hundred people may take part. They perform as characters from the story and people who lived in the town. And the performances can take place in the streets. Many people enjoy visiting these living nativity scenes.Some of these living nativity scenes are even famous. Over 100,000 people visit the island of Gozo in the weeks around Christmas. They come to this small island off Malta to experience a very special living nativity. Franco Ciangura is the mayor of the village of Ghajnsielem. He told the Guardian about the long tradition of building nativity scenes on the island.For generations, making nativity scenes has been a big thing at Christmas. Every home in Gozo has one. Sometimes they take up a whole room in the house. Families start making them in early December.\u2019But in 2008 Mayor Ciangura and the people of his village did something amazing. And they have done it every year since then. They created a life-size nativity scene. But they also created more. They created a whole village. They made a model of the village of Bethlehem from 2000 years ago. They built the \u2018Bethelehem\u2019 village on fields near their own village. It covers a large area of over 20,000 square metres.This \u2018Bethlehem\u2019 village looks very natural. People perform real jobs. A real baker and his wife make bread. A real carpenter works with wood. He is happy to talk to visitors about his work as he uses tools such as a lathe. This \u2018Bethlehem\u2019 also has a market that sells fresh fruit, vegetables and fish. And people can meet friends and eat and drink at the village inn. It looks like any normal village would from 2000 years ago. Mayor Ciangura told the Guardian newspaper why the village is like this,\u2018People have criticised me for making it too ordinary or normal, but this is how it really was. It was just an ordinary village. And in a stable a baby was born. And few people noticed. Just like here, life was going on as normal all around.\u2019Both local people and visitors enjoy the \u2018Bethlehem\u2019 village experience. Some people even stay in the village overnight.  says that 2000 years ago Mary and Joseph stayed in a stable. That is because there was no room for them anywhere else. But there is room for visitors today.And just like in Bethlehem 2000 years ago a baby is in a stable. In fact, more than one newborn baby plays the part of the baby Jesus. When Jesus was born, no one knew who he was \u2013 except the people represented in the nativity scene. He was just another baby. But in this living nativity Bethlehem everyone notices the baby. They know he is the reason people are celebrating. The baby born 2000 years ago is the reason for the celebration of Christmas.Have you ever seen a Christmas nativity scene?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Somewhere in the world, a farmer plants many seeds into a field. The farmer waters the fields. Soon, after , water, and time, the seeds grow into large plants. They are fruits, or vegetables or grain. The plants are full and ready to be used. It is time to take the fruit or vegetable or grain from the plant. It is time for the harvest.The harvest comes at the end of the growing season. This is usually a time when people have enough good food to eat. They eat as much as they want. They prepare and save some for the future when  is rare. But people also do something else at harvest time \u2013 they celebrate!People around the world celebrate the harvest during harvest festivals. During these festivals they eat good food. But they also give thanks for the great harvest. In today\u2019s Spotlight, we will look at some of the ways people around the world celebrate the harvest and give thanks!People have been celebrating the harvest for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans both celebrated the harvest. Ancient Greeks worshipped many gods and goddesses. They held a harvest festival to thank and honor their goddess Demeter. Ancient Romans worshipped a similar goddess called Cerelia. During these festivals, people gathered together to eat and drink. They played games and danced. They brought offerings of food to the goddesses. They hoped that their offerings would please the goddesses so they would have another good harvest the next year.Today, people still celebrate the harvest. They still show thanks for the food that grows from the ground.In Argentina, in the Mendoza Province, people celebrate the National Grape Harvest Festival. This province grows the fruit grapes. These grapes will be made into wine. Through December, January and February there are special events. One of these events happens on the last Sunday in February. It is a religious ceremony. The Archbishop of Mendoza puts holy water on the first grapes of the season. He thanks God for the harvest. The governor of the area also hits a plow \u2013 a tool for harvesting. This represents the end of the harvest. After this, people gather in the streets to watch parades. The celebrations end in early March. This is the main event. There is a show with lights, dancing and music. There are fireworks and even a beauty show. More than 20,000 people from all around the world attend this event.People in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is also called the Moon festival or Harvest Moon Festival. The Chinese have celebrated this festival for hundreds of years. It happens on the 15th day of the eighth month each year in the Chinese Han calendar. It is called the Moon Festival because the moon is very big and very bright at this time of year.The moon is a symbol of unity. During this festival, people gather together with friends and family. They give thanks for the harvest. They give thanks for their relationships. Finally, they pray for a good future.During this festival, people also eat a food called Moon Cake. These cakes are round, like the moon. They are a symbol for coming together. People give these cakes to family members and friends. This is a wish for those people to have a long and happy life.Another popular harvest festival happens in the United States. People there call it \u201cThanksgiving\u201d. The origins of this holiday go back hundreds of years. There is no clear record of what truly happened. But the story begins with a group of Pilgrims. The Pilgrims were a group of people from Europe who went to live in North America. They had a very difficult time during their first year there and many of them died. The next year they finally had a good harvest. They were very thankful and they wanted to celebrate. They invited their Native American friends to eat with them. Together the two groups prepared and ate a huge meal of corn, fruits, vegetables, fish and meat.Today, in the United States Thanksgiving is a very important holiday. It happens on the last Thursday of November. Families gather together from far distances. They eat turkey meat, vegetables and sweet desserts. Some play American football and they go to parades.In England, the Harvest Festival happens near the harvest moon. This tradition is very old. People in ancient England offered the first part of their harvest as a sacrifice to their fertility gods. Later, they used the last part of the harvest to make a doll. It was a symbol of the goddess of grain.England began celebrating their modern Harvest festival in 1853. That year, the leader of a church invited members of the church to a special event to give thanks. Today, people bring fruit and vegetables of the harvest into Christian churches to decorate them. They give food to people in the community who are hungry. It is a time to give thanks for food. It is also a time to share it with people who do not have enough food.Many countries around the world have harvest festivals. They give thanks for the food they have grown that year. They hope that the  will be as good or better the next year. Harvest time is also a good time to think about other things that people are thankful for \u2013 shelter, family, friends, health, love, and more.At harvest time, who do we thank for these things? Many harvest festivals have religious importance. People thank God for providing for them. However, many people also show thankfulness to each other. People show thankfulness to other people in many different ways. They can write a note or tell a person thank you for a gift or act. Some people do good things for others who have done good things for them.When you think about the harvest and giving thanks for it, whom do you thank? What are you thankful for? Where do the good things in your life come from?Do you celebrate a Harvest Festival in your culture? How do you celebrate? Are there special foods or ceremonies? Tell us about it.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.These are real news headlines. They come from the past few years and around the world. They are all about violent sports fans. Fans are loyal to a team or sport. Of course, not all sports fans are violent or bad. But fans do many extreme things because of sports games. Millions of people say that being a sports fan is one of the most important things in their lives. Why do people love sports so much? And why do fans support their teams so strongly? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the reasons people become sports fans and why they act in particular ways.Loyalty to sports teams crosses every border. People of every nationality, culture, income level, gender and age love to watch sports. Sports are entertaining. They are easy for anyone to access, and do not cost much. And people like to watch athletes perform! Athletes inspire us with their strength, skill and hard work. Many people follow one sport, and one team in particular.But being a loyal sports fan can have negative results. At the beginning of this program we heard examples of sports fan violence. People can also feel depressed when their team loses. However, being a sports fan has many positive results too. Fans feel great when their team wins! Studies show that sports fans think better thoughts about themselves. They are less depressed and less lonely. Dr. Daniel Wann is a leading expert on fan behavior. He made a list of 24 examples of social well-being that come with being a fan of a sports team. He tells the Seattle Times:\u201cThere has been a lot of research in my lab and by others in multiple cultures. It shows that when an individual becomes attached to a sports team, there are pretty clear mental benefits of that.\u201dBeing a fan also produces complex biological reactions and social behavior. Imagine you are watching your favorite team or athlete play a game. Your heart starts to beat faster. You become very excited. You are not moving much but you begin to sweat. Studies show this happens to many sports fans. They react physically to the game even though they are not playing.Chemicals in the fans\u2019 bodies also change in the same way that the athletes\u2019 bodies do. Experts call these \u201cmirror neurons.\u201d So sports fans experience a kind of mirror reflection of what they are watching. They feel tension. But they also experience the release of chemical substances in their body. These make the fans feel happy. Shankar Vedantam is a social science reporter for the news organization NPR. He says:\u201cSports allow us to feel intensely about something that really is not very important. The truth is, tomorrow, if your team wins or loses, you are still going to be OK. So in some ways watching sports is like watching a horror movie. You feel intensely but the risks are not that high.\u201dOur minds, emotions and bodies respond strongly to sports. And we respond even  if we care more. The other main reason people care so much about sports is social. Many people like to watch sports events with their friends and family. But the social element of being a sports fan is much more than that.People like belonging to a group. Being part of a team makes us feel we have things in common with the people around us. We form groups naturally. People are also naturally very loyal to their \u201cin-group.\u201d They feel they belong and connect emotionally to the other members of the group. They also often share a dislike for people in an \u201cout-group\u201d \u2013 like an opposing sports team. Christine Emba reports for the Washington Post:\u201cStudies have shown that for fans, being identified with a favorite team is more important than being identified with their work and social groups. And it is sometimes more important to them than being identified with their religion.\u201dOur attachment to sports teams comes from a deeper desire for connection. People want to feel valuable and important in the world. Some experts say we all want to be part of something larger than ourselves that will continue on, even after we die. Jeff Greenberg teaches social psychology at the University of Arizona. In the online science magazine Nautilus, he says:\u201cThe underlying importance of sports fanship is that need to feel good about yourself, the need for self-esteem and meaning. What is the point? Why do we need to feel valuable and good about ourselves and our place in the world? In a sense, that is what we are doing in our lives. We are trying to feel larger than our own lives, to feel higher than death. We want to feel that somehow we are going to continue on beyond. Sports are a symbolic version of the drama of life. Winning and losing feels like life and death.\u201dPeople have found many ways to belong to groups. Sports fans form a strong bond with other group members. In this way they satisfy the need to belong. And they fill the need to be part of something larger than themselves. When their team loses, they feel as if  have lost. And when their team wins, they celebrate victory.Lastly, there are some outside reasons to be a sports fan. Sports are a multi-billion dollar global business. It is good for people in this business when sports fans are loyal. Many people make a lot of money from sports that people watch. Sports are an important part of the global economy.Most people cheering for their team are probably not thinking about all these things. But it helps us to understand why sports are important to so many people around the world. Are sports important to you? What team do you support?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Two large men stand facing each other on a raised area. They stand inside a circle four and a half metres across. They show no emotion. A man moves around them. He wears colourful clothing. He will manage their fight. Thousands of people cheer for the two men. Everyone is waiting. Then the men begin. Their bodies smash together. Arms pull and hit. Legs push and bend. The crowd becomes louder. Suddenly, one man loses his balance. He is thrown to the ground. He has lost the match. The fight lasted only a few seconds. But that is what happens in Sumo.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Sumo Wrestling. Sumo Wrestling is the national sport of Japan. There are two ways to win a Sumo fight. You can push your opponent outside the circle. Or you can make them touch the ground with any part of their body that is not their feet. It sounds simple. But Sumo is rich in tradition, customs, and complex rules.The Sumo wrestler is a powerful athlete. However, he does not look like most athletes. In most fighting sports, the fighters are divided by weight. Small people only fight other small people. But Sumo are not divided by weight, so being large helps. Sumo wrestlers weigh around 90 kilograms when they begin to train. Top Sumo weigh between 130 and 180 kilograms. The largest Sumo ever weighed 272 kilograms.Sumo compete wearing only a mawashi. This traditional clothing is one long piece of cloth. It goes around the fighter\u2019s waist and between his legs. A fighter\u2019s hair is long. If any hair touches the ground, the fighter will lose the fight. So fighters tie their hair high on their heads. There is a different way to tie the hair for each Sumo skill level.There are many skill levels in Sumo. This list of skill levels, called the Banzuke, is very important. If a Sumo wins, he moves up the list. If a Sumo loses, he will move down the list. Moving up the Banzuke brings honour. But it also means more money, freedom, and moving closer to becoming a yokozunaA yokozuna is a great champion. A Sumo must win many fights to become a yokozuna. But he must also demonstrate grace and honour as he fights. His behaviour out of the competitions must also bring honour. Once he has become a yokozuna, he will be a yokozuna for life. If he does badly at a competition, he is expected to retire. In all the years of Sumo, only 68 men have become yokozuna.The Banzuke rankings also have meaning beyond the wrestling circle. Sumo train in a \u201cstable\u201d. Each stable has a trainer and group of Sumo that exercise together. Sumo compete by themselves. But these stables are similar to teams. Each stable has high and low ranked Sumo.The higher ranked Sumo are very famous. They are like sports super-stars anywhere in the world. They have money, popularity, and status. But for those at the bottom of the Banzuke, life is very different.Sumo at the bottom of the Banzuke must rise early in the morning. They must serve the higher ranked Sumo. They must cook the meals. They must clean. They must do what they are told to do. Sumo the lower rankings are not given any money or permitted to go out at night. These are all reasons for them to work hard and win more fights.Sumo began 1500 years ago. The first Sumo fights were connected closely to the Shinto religion. They were part of a celebration that included dancing, theatre, and prayers for a good harvest. As time went on, Sumo became a way to train men for war. It was a measure of strength and power. But in 1603, Japan\u2019s areas were united. This brought in a time of wealth and peace. Official Sumo organizations began. They established rules and traditions. Sumo was recognized as the national sport of Japan.Today, many people see Sumo as only a sport. However, there are still symbols of the Shinto religion found in Sumo. For example, before a Sumo enters the circle to compete, he must throw salt before him. This is believed to purify the circle. Then the Sumo must lift one foot high in the air and then bring in down against the ground. This is believed to keep evil spirits away. Sumo fighters are not required to be Shinto. But the influence of Shinto still surrounds Sumo.Sumo is still popular in Japan today. But some people criticize the sport. This is for several reasons. First, only a limited number of foreigners may compete. Also, no women are permitted to be Sumo. Another problem is the long term health effects of the Sumo life. When a Sumo retires, he becomes much less active. This can lead to problems such as knee and back pain, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. Most Japanese men live until they are eighty years old. But most Sumo live less than sixty years.Another serious criticism of Sumo is corruption. That is, the winner of a fight is chosen before the fight begins. Because the rankings are so important, some Sumo are willing to exchange money for losing a fight. This may permit a lower ranked Sumo to move up the banzuke.And finally, people are concerned about hazing. Hazing is when lower ranked Sumo are treated badly by higher ranked Sumo. In 2008, the leader of a stable and three Sumo were arrested over the death of a young Sumo. The leader of the stable had told the men to beat the boy. Even the leader had broken a bottle on the boy\u2019s head. This was an extreme case. But in the world of Sumo, training methods are often kept secret.To people outside of Japan, Sumo may seem like a simple competition between two fighters. But it is a complex sport, full of tradition, language, and ceremony. It also has its problems. But it is an important part of the cultural history and social identity of Japan.The writer and producer of this program was Adam Navis. The voices you heard were from the United States.

I\u2019m Robin Basselin.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Adil Das recently immigrated to Vancouver, Canada from eastern India. Das enjoys living in Canada. But sometimes he does not understand particular things about Canadian culture. One day, Das was watching television. A short advertisement began playing. A map of North America appeared on the television. On the map was a picture of a pig. Slowly, the pig began to grow. It got fatter and fatter. Soon, the pig covered the whole map. Then, a voice said,\u201cThe average North American buys five times more things than a Mexican, ten times more than a Chinese person, and 30 times more than a person from India.\u201dThe advertisement was a message about \u201cBuy Nothing Day.\u201d This holiday encourages people to stop buying things. Das is not sure how he feels about \u201cBuy Nothing Day.\u201d He works hard. And he wants his family to be able to buy things that they want. He wonders why Canadians would celebrate not buying anything. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the unusual holiday \u2013 \u201cBuy Nothing Day.\u201d\u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d began in the 1990s in Vancouver, Canada. It was the idea of a man named Kalle Lasn and his organization Adbusters. Before starting Adbusters, Lasn worked for many years in advertising. He helped companies research what influenced people to buy things. But Lasn began to question the ways advertisers influenced people to buy things. He also questioned the culture of buying. Was it good to make people feel like they should always want more and more? \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d criticizes this culture of consumerism.Lasn recognizes that people need to consume things. They have to buy things to eat, live and even enjoy life. But Lasn believes that many companies encourage people to consume far more than is necessary. Advertising this way helps companies make money. But Lasn believes it hurts people and culture. Lasn told The Sun Magazine,\u201cCompanies have reduced us to consumers. They encourage us not to take part in society. We are just supposed to listen and watch advertisements and then buy. The media tells us that our desire to belong can be satisfied at any store, for the right price.\u201dSo Lasn decided to use advertising against companies. Adbusters tries to help people understand some of the false values and ideas behind advertising. The main value Adbusters fights is the idea, \u201cYou must consume more to be happy.\u201d And one way they do this is by encouraging people to celebrate \u201cBuy Nothing Day!\u201d\u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d is celebrated on the fourth Friday of every November. Adbusters chose this day for a very important reason. It is the biggest buying day of the year. Advertisers call this day Black Friday.Black Friday is particularly famous in the United States. It is the day after the country\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday. On Thanksgiving, people in the United States gather with family and friends to eat a meal and give thanks. In recent years, stores began to reduce their prices the day after Thanksgiving. They wanted to encourage people to start buying gifts for the Christmas holiday in December.However, in recent years, Black Friday has become famous for something else: greed and violence. On Black Friday, stores offer extremely reduced prices. But they only offer limited amounts of product. So people come early in the morning \u2013 or even the night before \u2013 to stand in lines outside stores. Sometimes, people push or fight to be first into the store. Some people have even died in Black Friday riots!\u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d hopes to end the greed and violence of Black Friday. But its message is bigger than just Black Friday. \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d is for people in the United States and around the world. Many other countries also have growing problems with too much consumption. Sixty-two different countries, from Germany to Japan, already celebrate \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d. And the message is the same everywhere \u2013 buying too much hurts people, culture and the planet. The British \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d website explains,\u201cBuy Nothing Day is a simple idea. It fights consumer culture by asking us to stop buying for a day. Anyone can do it if they spend a day without buying.\u201dFor some people, \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d is a protest. For other people, it is a party. Some groups go to stores and encourage other people not to buy things. Other people gather together to make Christmas gifts instead of buying them. And some people use the day to create works of art that protest against consumer messages. Often, people celebrate by enjoying the free gift of nature. They go for walks or watch the sunset together. The only rule of \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d is not to buy anything!Some people question if \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d can really change culture. It is only one day. And telling people not to do something often does not work! Other people say that consumers should not just buy less, but they should buy better. These people encourage consumers to buy things that are made in ways that do not hurt people or the environment.But \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d does get people thinking about the negative effects of buying too much. Kalle Lasn told The Independent news organization,\u201cA lot of people have had deep learning experiences when they tried celebrating \u201cBuy Nothing Day\u201d. It was like giving up an addiction to drugs.\u201dBuying more and more things can be like an addiction. Often, the more people  things, the more things they want. Tom Gilovich is a human behavior scientist. He performed several studies that examined people\u2019s emotions when they buy things. And he found that people are happier and more satisfied when they spend money on experiences instead of things. He wrote,\u201cSatisfaction over purchases decreases over time. A new car does not stay new for very long. But a satisfying experience often becomes more positive over time as we remember it.\u201dSo, what do you think about \u201cBuy Nothing Day?\u201d Is buying too much a problem in your culture?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Have you ever had a problem? You are a person, so of course you have! Maybe your  would not start. Maybe you needed to fix a toilet. Maybe you did not know how to download something to your smartphone. All people have problems. But what was the first thing you did to solve your problem?If you can connect to the Internet, one of the first things you probably did was search there for an answer. There, you can find information and videos to help you with almost any problem. These how-to videos are very popular. That is because more and more people are interested in doing things themselves. More people are becoming interested in growing, making, and fixing things. This growing interest is known as the maker movement. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the maker movement.\u00a0The maker movement includes a lot of different people and ideas. It includes people working independently to invent, create or design. Makers are people who design and create their own clothes or grow their own food. Many makers look at things in the world and say, \u201cI could make that.\u201d Or they may say, \u201cI think I could make that better.\u201d Or they dream of something they wish existed. And when they do not find it, they try to create it.People have always made things. Ancient people made baskets, bowls, and tools. One generation of people taught the next. Parents taught children. This was how people shared knowledge, experience, and wisdom with each other.But things started to change. Machines made it easier to grow food. So, fewer people needed to work on farms. So they moved to cities. They found work in factories. But then factories started to use machines. It started to cost less money to buy a new thing than to fix an old one. People began to forget how to grow food, create things, or fix things when they broke.And many people are tired of this. They do not want to throw things away. They want to be able to fix things that break. They want to grow their own food. They do not want to depend on factories or stores. They want to use knowledge and skills instead of spending money. In this way, the maker movement is a kind of return to the way things used to be.The maker movement includes traditional work like weaving cloth, making things out of wood, and growing your own food. But it also accepts and uses new technologies. Computers are now much less frightening to people than they used to be. More people understand how they work. Children learn to write code for computers in school. The Internet provides training and a way to connect to other makers.People in the maker movement come together to make things. Maker Faires are gatherings of these people. They spend a few days together talking, planning, inventing, and solving problems. These Faires began in the United States, but have spread to every continent. For example, in 2016 there was a Maker Faire in Shenzhen, China. At the Faire people taught wooden knife making, drawing, and how to build a robot out of . There was even a clothes fashion show. Much of the clothing was wearable technology. It had built-in computers, lights, or body sensors.Another kind of gathering of makers is called a Repair Caf\u00e9. People bring their broken things to the Repair Caf\u00e9. The Caf\u00e9 has tools and supplies to fix things. There are also experts who offer to teach people how to fix what they have brought in. But whenever possible, the people must do the work themselves. Repair Caf\u00e9s began in Amsterdam, but have also spread around the world. There are Repair Caf\u00e9s in Egypt, Kenya, Ghana, Thailand, Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Azerbaijan, China and many other countries.And the maker movement is still growing. It is even starting to change education. Some schools are creating \u201cmaker spaces.\u201d In these places, children can invent, combine, and discover. Jim Tiffin is a teacher in New York, in the US. His students do not just sit and listen to him talk. In the maker-space, they\u00a0\u00a0things. He told the Scholastic website,\u201cIt has had the most empowering effect on students of any of the courses that I have taught. Students are taking the experiences from this class and using them in their other classes.\u201dExperts say that any school can be a maker space like this. They do not need high cost equipment or supplies. They can use paper, broken toys, string, clay or tape. Any materials will work. Students just have to make things!But schools are not the only places interested in the maker movement. Some big businesses also try to use the maker movement to sell more products. The clothing company Levis sells millions of pairs of blue jeans around the world. Many people do not consider them to be part of the maker movement. But Levis tries to find people who are making creative things. Then they put these things on their website. Big businesses like this tell the stories of these makers. People like the stories and buy more clothing. This way they try to seem like they are part of the maker movement even if they are making clothes in big factories.Many people do not want to just use things and throw them in the garbage. They want to use their hands. They want to learn. They want to be independent and in control. Tim Bajarin wrote about the maker movement for Time Magazine. He wrote:\u201cThe more I look into it, the more I believe that the maker movement is very important to America\u2019s future. It may be able to turn more and more people into makers instead of just people who use things. I know from history that when you give makers the right tools and good ideas, they can change the world.\u201dDo you like to learn new things? Do you like to create and repair?

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine a world where monsters are real. But these are not the frightening creatures that you see in films. And they are also different from the monsters in traditional stories. Some of these monsters live with humans. Some live in the wild, like animals. These creatures are more intelligent than animals. They even have amazing special powers. Some can fly and breathe fire. One looks like a big black snake, with steel skin. But not all the monsters look so frightening. Some are very cute. Some are even beautiful. One very famous one looks like a yellow mouse with a big round face.This imagined world of strange creatures is the world of Pok\u00e9mon. And this world exists inside a video game! Today, this video game has grown to include television programs, books, trading cards, toys, and many other things. It is famous around the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the amazing world of Pok\u00e9mon.Satoshi Tajiri created Pok\u00e9mon. He was born in Japan in 1968. As a child, Tajiri loved collecting insects. He spent many hours by lakes. There, he observed different animals and insects. Tajiri told Time Magazine Asia:\u201cEvery time I found a new insect, it was a mystery to me. The more I searched for insects, the more I found. If I put my hand in the river, I would find water insects there. If there was a stick over a hole, I would find insects underneath it. As I gathered more, I learned more about them. I saw how some even eat each other.\u201dBut Tajiri was also very interested in video games. As a young man, he played them all of the time. Tajiri knew he wanted to make video games as an adult. As young adults, he and a friend began their own video game company. One of their video games was an early version of Pok\u00e9mon.To make Pok\u00e9mon, Tajiri combined the two things he loved most: insects and video games. As an adult, he remembered his experiences as a child. He remembered how he liked finding insects in the grass. He thought this could make a good game. People could collect Pok\u00e9mon creatures like he collected insects. For him, collecting  had been like exploring a new world. Could he give that experience to other people in a game?In the game of Pok\u00e9mon, the player plays the part of the trainer. A trainer is a person who works with Pok\u00e9mon. Trainers travel around the game world. They collect as many different kinds of Pok\u00e9mon as they can. Together, the trainer and Pok\u00e9mon also enter competitions. They battle against other Pok\u00e9mon and trainers.The video game company Nintendo agreed to make Tajiri\u2019s game. Tajiri wanted to make two games, called Pok\u00e9mon Red and Pok\u00e9mon Green. People would play them on Nintendo\u2019s Game Boy. Game Boy was a very small video game system. A person could carry it with them. It was very popular with young children.But the Game Boy had another important element that made it very important for the Pok\u00e9mon game: the link cable. The link cable was a short black wire. It connected one Game Boy to another. Tajiri wanted people playing the game to collect Pok\u00e9mon. But he also wanted them to trade Pok\u00e9mon. They could do this through the link cable. Their Pok\u00e9mon could even battle. This would give people another reason to play the game. Many video games involve only one person. But in Pok\u00e9mon, many people could play at once. They could share in their experiences together. Tom Battey of Gamasutra.com shared his experience as a child. He says,\u201cIt was a process that brought us together. Some children get each other friendship bracelets. Or some come closer by sharing illegal experiences. We traded Pok\u00e9mon.\u201dIt took six years to create the first Pokemon games. And Nintendo released the games on February 27, 1996. Satoshi Tajiri did not make money on Pok\u00e9mon in the beginning. It was not an immediate success, even in Japan. People needed time to explore the world of Pok\u00e9mon. But soon, they told their friends about it. And these friends told other friends. The game had many different levels and layers. Players could explore all parts of it.Nintendo sold more and more Pok\u00e9mon games. And Pok\u00e9mon began to spread to other kinds of entertainment. A Pok\u00e9mon television program began in Japan in 1997. One year later, the television program began in North America. Over one and a half million people watched it.Another famous part of the Pok\u00e9mon world is the trading card game.\u00a0 These cards are thick pieces of paper. Each one has a different Pok\u00e9mon on the front. Some are more difficult to find than others, just like in the video game. People can use the cards to play Pok\u00e9mon, just like in the video game. They can trade their Pok\u00e9mon and battle.Today, Pok\u00e9mon is over 20 years old. Nintendo has released over 50 different Pok\u00e9mon video games. The children who first played the game are adults. Some of them have children of their own. Now, these children can also explore the world of Pok\u00e9mon. The idea of Pok\u00e9mon has expanded to include books, television programs, toys and many other things. It continues to grow and become more popular.The world of Pok\u00e9mon has changed a lot. There are hundreds of new Pok\u00e9mon. And there are new ways to play through the internet. People can now trade Pok\u00e9mon online. They can make friends from other countries. But although the game has changed, much remains the same.Do you play Pok\u00e9mon?

I\u2019m Joshua Leo.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Jaap Stam was living the dream of many young people. He was an athlete. Playing football was his job. As a sports player, Stam was healthy and successful. He had played for the famous football team Manchester United. He had a new job on another good football team \u2013 Lazio. But, in 2001 he took a test. The test found that he had used the drug steroids.Stam spent four months banned from football. He said that he had not used steroids on purpose. Stam returned to play football for many years. But he is only one of many athletes who have taken steroids. Why do some athletes use these drugs? What effect do steroids have on the body and on sports? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on sports and steroids.Steroids are a strong version of testosterone. Human bodies create testosterone naturally. Women have low levels of testosterone. Men usually have higher levels of testosterone. This is why men usually have more muscle \u2013 the hard tissue on the body that gives people strength.Steroids give a person a very high level of testosterone. This makes the muscles in a person\u2019s body grow faster and larger. Steroids were first invented as a medicine. They can be taken in by mouth, rubbed on the skin or injected. They have been used to treat people with cancer, HIV and AIDS and other diseases. But people who are not sick also use steroids.Athletes began using steroids in the 1950s. Steroids gave athletes an advantage. They could be stronger and faster than their competitors. By the 1960s many major sports organizations had passed laws against using steroids. The organizations began to test athletes to make sure that they were not using steroids.But if taking steroids was against the rules, why would athletes take them? Some people say that  feel a large amount of pressure to win. They think that athletes use steroids because other people expect so much of them. Athletes must always run faster, jump higher and be stronger! Jose Conseco is a famous baseball player in the United States. He admitted to using steroids. He told the U.S. House of Representatives:\u201cThere was so much pressure to win games, please my supporters, and get the big contract, for more money. It led me, and others, to behaviour that would produce immediate results. This is the same pressure that leads young people today to that same behaviour.\u201dFor these reasons, some athletes choose to take steroids. But when they do, they are also facing many risks. There are professional risks and also social and physical risks. Omar Ortiz is a football player from Mexico. In 2010 he took a test that said he had taken steroids. He was banned from playing football for two years.An athlete may also lose her awards. Marion Jones is a runner. In the year 2000 she won five medals at the Olympic games. But Jones had to return her awards because she had used steroids. Jones understood that her use of drugs affected her body. She also saw that it affected many other people. The Washington Post reports that Jones said:\u201cI want to apologize to you all for all of this. I am sorry for making you all sad in so many ways.\u201dThere are also problems for the sport when people are found to be using steroids.\u00a0 Sports are based on being healthy and playing fairly \u2013 by the rules. People may lose interest in a sport if they know that some athletes have an unfair advantage.Steroids can also have many negative effects on physical health. These are problems with growing well and skin and hair problems. Steroids can also cause problems with the heart and the liver. They increase the chance of stroke and cancer. There are also side effects of steroids that affect behavior. People who use steroids can become very angry without reason. The steroids may make them feel sad and worried. But many people use steroids even when they know the risks of physical problems.And many of the people who use steroids are quite young.\u00a0 Dr. Linn Goldberg works for the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. She tells the news organization MSNBC:\u201cSports role models are very powerful in a young child\u2019s life. They think that if a professional athlete had to use that, then maybe I should use that.\u201dThe National Institute on Drug Abuse looked at young people in the United States. They found that over half of a million young people are using steroids. These 13 to 15 year olds care very much about doing well in sports. They are also very concerned about having a strong body. They are even willing to take risks with their health. Studies show that using steroids is even more dangerous for very young people.Yet there are also people with different ideas about steroids and sports. Some people argue that steroids should be made legal. Some people say that steroids are not very different than what athletes have been doing for many years. Kenan Malik of the BBC says:\u201cBut scientists already help athletes win. Cyclist Chris Boardman won his Olympic Gold in 1992. He was sitting on a specially created machine \u2013 his two wheeled bicycle. In the Rugby World Cup, England players wore special shirts. These shirts were very close to their bodies. They were designed so the other team could not hold on to them. In these two cases the scientific work did not reduce the sporting victory. Why should we see drug use differently?\u201dOther people say that if steroids were legal, they would cause less damage. Adrianne Blue writes in The New Statesman:\u201cSteroids may not be desirable, but they are here to stay. We should make steroids legal. Then they can be controlled. And athletes will not take too much and do themselves damage.\u201dDo you think that making steroids legal would be a good solution? What is the effect of steroid use on your favorite sport?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live. was 13 years old. His family decided to go on a long hike. They planned to walk for many days through forests and mountains. They would carry everything they needed. They planned everything well. But a few days into their hike, the family had no more food. However, they did have a book that identified which plants they could eat. They survived by eating plants they found. Boutenko explains in his book about finding food,\u201cWild food grew everywhere along the trail, so it soon became the main thing we ate. By the end, most of our diet was wild plants. All of the new plants we used in our meals were fresh and very good for our bodies. We were amazed how much we enjoyed the flavor of our food and always looked forward to the next meal. In short, discovering wild food let us successfully finish our hike.\u201dThis event started Boutenko\u2019s love for finding food in nature. There are many people just like him in many parts of the world. They love to forage or search, for food. Foraging can save money, improve health, and change how people see the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on foraging for food.For most of human history, people did not get their food from a store. There were no large factory farms that put food in boxes and cans. People ate the food they grew on their own land. They hunted wild animals. And many people want to return to this way of living.Foraging has become popular in recent years. People like Boutenko understand that there is food all around us. People have just forgotten how to see it. Brigit Anna McNeill teaches people how to forage. She also writes on her blog about foraging and how it connects people to the earth.\u201cThere is a lack of connection in our modern lives. It cannot be replaced with the latest iPhone, dress, bag, shoes or party. Many people live and work surrounded by concrete and steel. They eat processed foods. This limits contact with nature. Eating and gathering wild food brings me to nature. I know when I am eating more wild food, I feel more alive. I think of food as the greatest medicine and wild food is full of so much goodness that it heals me from the inside.\u201dPeople who forage for food say there are many benefits to foraging. The first is that it can be very fun to do. Walking through nature is good for everyone. Children especially love to find plants they can eat. It can feel like hunting for treasure. It is a wonderful way for families to spend time together.Foraging can also save money. No matter where you live in the world, people spend a lot of money of food. Foraging can reduce the amount of money spent of food.And eating wild food both tastes good and is good for you. It is healthy food. There are berries, fruits, mushrooms, seeds, ocean mussels, flowers, and spices and herbs that grow wild. And wild food grows everywhere. You can forage no matter where you live.Foraging can also change the way you see the world. When you can walk through a park or a forest and see food all around you, it changes you. People who forage are able to see that the world is not a frightening place. It is full of life. Everything we need to live has been provided for us.If you want to start foraging there are a few steps you should follow before you start eating what you find. First, find an experienced forager. Not all plants are edible. Some can make you very sick. An experienced forager will help you know which plants are safe to eat. \u00a0Many places around the world have foraging groups or clubs. People in these clubs forage together. They share knowledge and information about what plants are good to eat and what plants to avoid.Second, get a good guide book. A good guide book will identify all the edible plants where you live. It will have pictures of the plants. It will also tell you what parts of the plant you can eat. Plants have leaves, roots, stems, flowers and fruit. Just because you can eat one part does not mean you can eat all parts.Third, learn the common poisonous plants in your area before you begin to forage. This will help you feel more comfortable foraging. And before you eat any plant you find, you should know it is completely safe to eat. Never guess if a plant is safe or not.Fourth, use all of your senses to identify plants you find. Plants smell, feel, and look different from each other. Use all of these senses to identify a plant.Finally, foragers must remember a few simple rules for foraging. Robin Shreeves wrote about foraging in Finland for the website Mother Nature Network. She suggested a few general rules to follow when you forage.\u201cFor your own safety, know how to correctly identify edible plants. Many plants can be poisonous. If you are in an area that has been sprayed with chemicals, like a public park, the edge of a farm, or someone\u2019s back yard \u2013 those wild plants could be covered with chemicals. Also, take only what you will use. Leave at least half, even if you could use more. Do not step on other plants to get to your desired food. And make sure you have permission to forage on the land. If you are on private property or publicly owned property such as a park or nature area, foraging may not be permitted. Finally, if a plant has damaged leaves, mold, dark spots or other signs of being unhealthy, do not eat from it.\u201dForaging can be fun, save money, and make you healthy. But some people do not like the idea of finding their own food. Do you think you would like to try foraging for food? Do you already forage for food? Tell us about your experiences.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine two men. Ahmad lives in Saudi Arabia. Alexander lives in Russia. These men are similar in many ways. They each work for a computer company. They each have a wife and two children. They each play on a local football team each Saturday. But there is something different about these two men. On many days after work, Alexander meets friends to  beer and tell stories. Ahmad does not do this. He has never had a drink of alcohol in his whole life.Ahmad and Alexander are not real people. But they represent many real people around the world. They also represent two positions on drinking alcohol. The first position is that people can drink alcohol every day. The second position is that people should never drink alcohol. But why is there such a difference? Is one correct? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on drinking alcohol around the world.In 2014, the World Health Organization did a study on alcohol and public health. They found that people around the world over 15 years old drank 13 grams of alcohol every day. This is about one drink each day. However, that is an average. Over 60 percent of people in the world do not drink\u00a0\u00a0alcohol. This means that people who\u00a0\u00a0drink, really average two drinks each day.The countries with the highest levels of drinking are countries of Eastern Europe. These include Russia, but also Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Romania, and Ukraine. A country like Belarus has almost two times the global average. People in Belarus average four alcoholic drinks every day.But drinking alcohol is nothing new. People have been drinking alcohol for thousands of years. Experts have found ancient evidence that people drank alcohol. Andrew Curry wrote about this evidence for National Geographic.\u201cExperts have shown that alcohol is one of the most universally produced and enjoyed substances in history. People were drinking alcohol long before they invented writing. Recent chemical research showed that the Chinese were making a kind of wine from rice, honey, and fruit 9,000 years ago. In the Caucasus Mountains of modern-day Georgia and the Zagros Mountains of Iran, grapes were one of the earliest fruits farmers grew. Wine was made as early as 7,400 years ago.\u201dBut still, half the world does not drink any alcohol at all. The countries that drink the lowest amount of alcohol are Pakistan, Kuwait, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia. Most of the people in these countries are Muslim \u2014 they follow the religion of Islam. Many people in these countries believe that they should not drink alcohol at all.Islam is not the only religion that speaks against drinking alcohol. Many religions warn against drinking alcohol or drinking too much of it. There are warnings against drinking too much alcohol in Judaism, Christianity, Buddism, and Hinduism.So, half the world drinks alcohol every day. The other half of the world does not drink any. Why does alcohol divide people so much? Iain Gately is the author of the book Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol. He spoke the radio program, On The Media.\u201cWhen I looked into the subject of alcohol, I was surprised most by the two different and opposite sides of alcohol. In fact, the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, had exactly those two sides to his character. He could be loving and he supported the theater and many of the arts. Yet, at the same time, he could suddenly be full of anger and violence.\u201dThere are risks in drinking alcohol. One big risk is alcohol addiction \u2013 when a person must drink alcohol before anything else. Alcohol addiction can cause people to lose their job, friends, or even their lives. But even in situations that are not as bad, alcohol can have negative effects. When people drink alcohol they do not make the same decisions they would if they were not drinking. People who drink alcohol are more likely to do risky things. This could include driving a car, fighting, taking drugs, or having sex. These risks do not always just affect the person drinking \u2013 they can affect other people too. For example, when a person decides to drink alcohol and drive a car, he or she could kill another person.Drinking a lot of alcohol is also bad for your health. If a person stops drinking for as little as 30 days, positive changes can happen in their body. People will have less fat in their liver. Their skin will be clearer. They will sleep better, have better concentration, and lose weight. Dr. James Ferguson spoke to NPR about giving up alcohol.\u201cPeople always forget the amount of calories in alcohol. If you take a month off from drinking and you usually drink 20 drinks in that time, you are going to lose weight and fat. It is a very big decrease in calories.\u201dSo with all these negative risks, why would someone drink alcohol? Because there are also good things that come from drinking alcohol. Experts encourage people to drink in moderation. That is, they drink a moderate, or responsible amount. When people drink in moderation, it can bring people together. In 2012 Psychological Science published a study. They found that alcohol helped people in social situations feel connected to each other. It increased the amount of time people talked to each other. And it reduced the amount of negative emotions they expressed. Drinking alcohol with other people creates community in the same way that laughing, singing and dancing can.But scientists have also found that some alcohol can have a good effect on health. For example, red wine contains substances called antioxidants. These substances can help prevent heart disease. Drinking red wine in moderation may be good for your heart.But for many people, these benefits are not worth it. They prefer to drink none at all. What about you? Do you enjoy drinking alcohol?

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.How much money would you pay for a pair of shoes? Christopher Michael Shellis is a  designer. He designs beautiful jewelry that people can wear around their fingers, necks, or wrists. In 2011, he designed a very interesting pair of shoes. The shoes were made of solid gold. They were covered with over 2,000 shiny diamonds. Shellis called the shoes \u201cjewelry you can wear on your feet\u201d. These shoes cost more money than any other shoes in the world \u2014 140,000 Great British Pounds!Most people cannot buy expensive shoes like these. And many people do not even want them! But people everywhere do wear shoes. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on shoes. A shoe seems like a simple thing \u2013 it just needs to protect a foot from the ground. But there are many different kinds of shoes from all around the world. And the history and culture of each place has influenced the design of its shoes. Today, we  around the world looking at shoes!In the Middle East, religion has influenced shoe design. One popular kind of shoe here is the babouche. This design of shoe is a traditional shoe from Morocco. Traditional babouches are made from soft leather. They have a pointed toe. Some have bead decorations, or a design made from thin, colored, thread.So how has religion influenced this shoe design? People worshipping at a mosque must remove their shoes. They may not wear shoes when they enter. So, they want a shoe they can remove easily. Babouches cover most of the foot. But they do not cover the heel, or back of the foot. This makes the shoe easy to put on and to remove. People also like babouches because they do not make a person\u2019s foot too hot. And they are very comfortable.Religion and culture have also influenced the design of shoes in India. The paduka is a very old shoe design there. Experts believe this design is over 4,000 years old! It is a sandal \u2013 it does not cover the whole foot. But it goes on the foot easily and keeps it cool.Padukas have a simple design. A paduka maker cuts a piece of wood into the rough shape of the bottom of a foot. Then, he adds a small knob on the top. This knob is a small round piece of wood. It sits between a person\u2019s first two toes. Under the base of the shoe, there are thin rounded pieces of wood in the back and front. These pieces of wood raise the shoe off the ground.The Hindu religion is common in India. Hindus believe they should not harm any living thing. The design of padukas follows this idea. The area of the shoe that touches the ground is very small. It is less likely to harm the ground under it or any insect around it. Also, padukas are never made from leather \u2013 animal skin. Instead, they are always made from wood, ivory or metal. Today, very religious people usually wear padukas. Or people may wear them to a special ceremony or event.Travel with us now to a much colder climate \u2013 the country of Finland, in . The people here would not wear sandals at all! Instead, the Saami people of Finland wear very warm boots. The Saami people keep and raise reindeer. Reindeer are very large animals. They have antlers \u2013 long, hard, bones that grow from their heads. The Saami people keep the reindeer for food. But the reindeer also provide the Saami with the material for their boots!Voice 1\u00a0 Traditional Saami reindeer boots cover a person\u2019s whole foot. And they may cover some of the leg too. The Saami make these traditional boots from reindeer skin leather. The hair on the skin helps make the boots very warm. Reindeer hair is shaped like a tube. It has air inside. This helps keep the reindeer warm. It also means that reindeer boots are very warm! Traditional reindeer boots have a point or a kind of hook at the end \u2013 the end of the boot points up.Many cultures have influenced the design of shoes. But shoes also become an important part of a culture. This is the case with klompen from . Each klompen shoe is made from a solid piece of wood. The inside of the shoe is cut out, so a foot can go in it. Many people think of klompen when they think of the Netherlands.The design of klompen shoes is over 800 years old. They were originally the shoe of factory workers. That is because klompen are excellent at protecting feet. They protect feet from sharp objects and harmful liquid acids. Today, few people wear klompen as a common shoe. But people may wear them for working outside. And they are a very popular thing people bring home when they visit the Netherlands!Finally, we travel to . Here, we see geta. Geta are a traditional shoe in Japan. A geta sandal is usually made from wood and cloth. When wearing a geta, a person\u2019s foot sits on a long square of wood. In the middle of the geta there is a cloth that forms a shape like a letter \u201cV\u201d. This cloth comes up in the center of the sandal. It goes between a person\u2019s first and second toes, and then to the middle of the sandal. When a person\u2019s foot is in geta, it is not in the center of the geta. But this also means each geta \u2013 the one for the right foot, and the one for the left foot \u2013 looks the same.Under the base of the shoe there are two straight wooden \u201cha\u201d. This word means \u201cteeth\u201d in the Japanese language. There are ha in the front and in the back. Usually geta are about 3-5 centimetres tall. They are a popular shoe for men and women in Japan.It is easy to see how each place and each culture needs their own kind of shoe. Is there a special kind of shoe in your culture?

I\u2019m Dave Bast.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cPeter Menzel and I invited ourselves to dinner with 30 families in 24 countries. We wanted to explore people\u2019s oldest social activity: eating.\u201dThese are the words of writer Faith D\u2019Aluisio. Peter Menzel is her husband. He is also a photographer \u2013 he takes beautiful pictures. Together, they travel the world. Faith writes about the things and people they see. And Peter takes pictures.In the mid 1990s, Faith and Peter began to notice how people\u2019s diets across the world were changing. They decided to write a book about their observations. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on this book called\u00a0.Food is a very important part of family life. It is part of everyone\u2019s history and culture. Faith D\u2019Aluisio and Peter Menzel wanted to show how diet affects health and culture. And they wanted to present this information in a beautiful way. In their book, Faith explains:\u201cTo learn more about how diets are changing, we watched normal families all over the world. We watched as they farmed, shopped at the market, cooked, and ate. At the end of each visit, we created a picture of the family. In the picture, the family is surrounded by all the food they normally eat in one week.\u201dEach chapter in the book\u00a0, starts with this large picture of a family. All the food they eat in a week is spread around them. Under the picture are the names of the family members. There are also the names of the city and country where they live.The information also includes how the family prepares their food. Some families use a stove or a small electric microwave to cook their food. Other families cook around a fire on the ground. The book also explains how each family keeps their food fresh. Many families use an electric refrigerator to keep food cold. But other families must eat everything they prepare immediately. They have no way to keep their food fresh.For each picture, D\u2019Aluisio and Menzel organized the families\u2019 weekly food into groups \u2013 like meat, fruits and vegetables, milk products, grains and bread, and drinks. They added up the money spent on each food group. Then they found the total amount of money each family spends on food in one week. Nick Page and Marina Santee share some examples from the book:The Madsen family lives in Cap Hope village in Greenland. Five people live in the home. They spend $277 each week on food. They also hunt animals to eat fresh meat. These are animals that live in ice cold water such as polar bears, walrus, and arctic geese. Many people in Greenland hunt these large animals for their meat.The Mendoza family live in Todos Santos Cuchumatan, Guatemala. Eight people live in the home. They spend $25 a week on food. The Mendoza family only eat meat less than once a week. They spend most of their money on fruits and vegetables like bananas, zapote, passion fruit, avocados, green beans, and red chili peppers.The Al Haggan family lives in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Eight people live in the Al Haggan home. They spend $221 on food each week. Much of the food they eat is imported from other countries. They buy it at a western style market.The Revis family live in North Carolina, in the United States. There are four people in the family. They spend $342 each week on food. They spend a lot of their money on fast food from eating places like McDonalds, Taco Bell and pizza places.The Aboubakar family is from Darfur, Sudan. But they live as refugees in the country of Chad. D\u2019jimia is a single mother. She has five children. The family spends a little over one dollar on food each week. Food does not cost as much here as in some other places. In other countries, where food costs more, this amount would be equal to about $24. Most of their meals are a thick liquid porridge made from the grain . D\u2019jimia also receives food aid in her refugee camp. Some days the family lacks food. They must make difficult decisions. They must decide who gets more food, and who gets less.These are just a few of the examples of the families in the book\u00a0. All of the pictures in the book show the different food cultures of people around the world. Some people grow most of their food on their own land. Other people buy almost everything at a market. Others do not even cook much of their food. They buy food that is already prepared.People reading the book can also see how money influences food. Some families have enough money to eat any kind of food they want. They can buy food imported from other countries at the market. But many people must eat only what grows in their own area, depending on the season.\u00a0 Some families eat a large amount of food. And other families must divide a limited amount of food.The book\u00a0\u00a0is not about food politics. The book\u2019s authors, D\u2019Aluisio and Menzel, are not exploring\u00a0hunger exists in the world. They are only sharing what they experienced. The purpose of the book is to help people understand how other people live.The book also encourages people to look at their own family and how\u00a0eat. Remember the Revis family from the United States? After seeing their picture in the book, the Revis family felt shame about the food they were eating. Mrs. Revis told D\u2019Aluisio and Menzel:\u201cEveryone in our family felt very troubled by the large amount and kinds of food on the table for the picture. Before my son eats something now, he will say to me, \u2018Mom, how healthy do you think this food is?\u2019 That never happened before\u201d.People have different customs but we share many similarities. D\u2019Aluisio and Menzel found that around the world people love food. And people in every culture love to welcome new friends to eat with their family. What are the cultural food customs in your family?\u00a0 What foods are common in your culture?

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on a food people eat all around the world. It is pizza! Very simply, pizza is a food made by putting meat and vegetables, called toppings, on top of bread. But pizza is not the same everywhere. All around the world, people enjoy different toppings on their pizzas.In Brazil, green peas are popular on pizza.In Japan, food from the sea, like eel and squid are popular.In Costa Rica, people enjoy the coconut fruit on top of their pizzas.In Italy, the bread, or crust, of the pizza may be the most important part. It can be more important than anything that goes on it!But in the Netherlands toppings are very important! A popular pizza in the Netherlands is called the \u201cDouble Dutch.\u201d It has two times the cheese, two times the onions, and two times the beef! It has two times the toppings!As you can see, there are many different ways to eat pizza. And each way is correct! The simple design of pizza is the same all over the world. But everyone likes something different on top of it. It is common for different cultures to have their own kinds of food. A food that is popular in one culture will not always be popular in another culture. But pizza seems to cross all these barriers. Pizza is popular in almost every part of the world! So, why is pizza so popular? Where did it even come from?No one really knows  the idea for modern pizza started. But experts do agree that the design, or recipe, for modern pizza was probably put together using different ideas from different cultures. A few cultures already had a simple common recipe for pizza almost 2000 years ago!Even before that, Middle Eastern cultures had something similar to pizza. Babylonians, Israelites, and Egyptians liked to eat flat, cooked bread. They would add olive oil and good tasting spices to the bread. Then they cooked this flat, spiced bread in hot ovens made of earth or on top of hot, flat stones. It was a small food that people ate between meals. Or they added it to a meal.Another version of this flat round bread was also popular in Greece. The Greeks called it \u201cplakountos.\u201d They put vegetables and meat on top of the flat bread.But many experts believe that the version of pizza that people know best today started in the city of Naples, in Italy. It was a street food. Poor people there spent a lot of time outside of their very small homes. They could buy this food and eat it easily as they walked outside.One more thing added to the creation of the modern pizza. They put tomatoes on their pizza street food. Today, this soft, red fruit is the most popular fruit in the world. But back in the 1700s, people thought it was poisonous. But that did not stop them from eating it!Finally, the popularity of pizza began to grow.\u00a0 Shops opened where people could buy pizza. In 1830, the first pizzeria opened in Naples, Italy. This restaurant only sold pizza. But the pizza of that time still looked a little different from the modern pizza we know today. However, in 1889, Don Raffaele Esposito created the first modern pizza. Katy Blake tells the story.Queen Margherita Theresa was visiting Naples. She had heard of pizza, but she had never tried it. During her visit to Naples, she finally decided to try it! Don Raffaele was a famous pizza maker. She asked him to make a special pizza for her.So, Don Raffaele created three pizzas. But he designed one pizza especially for the Queen. He added three toppings to the pizza. The first topping was mozzarella cheese. Mozzarella cheese was made from the milk of a water buffalo \u2013 a kind of local cow. It is a white cheese. The next topping was red tomatoes. Finally, Don Raffaele added basil leaves. Basil is a green plant with a mild spicy taste. These three toppings were white, red and green \u2013 the colors of the Italian flag. He called this pizza the Margherita Pizza. The Queen was very happy \u2014 she loved the pizza! And the Margherita Pizza is still a very popular kind of pizza today!After this event, people no longer considered pizza a poor person\u2019s food. Everyone, rich or poor, enjoyed this easy-to-eat, delicious food. As people began to travel more often, they began sharing the news about pizza.Today, people all over the world eat more than five billion pizzas every year. The recipe for pizza has changed over the years. Today people usually make pizza by putting sauce, a kind of thick liquid, over the crust. The most popular kind of sauce is made from tomatoes. Then cheese and toppings of all kinds go on top of the sauce. But pizza makers have tried to put almost any kind of food you can imagine on top of a pizza!People all over the world have helped to create the recipe for pizza. It is a food that combines different foods from different countries. And it is probably one of the oldest foods you can think of! But one of the best things about pizza is this: you can create your own special kind of pizza. You can put anything you like on it. You can mix different foods from different cultures and create something wonderful. Who would have expected that such an ancient and simple food would be popular today? Pizza is just one example of how great things can happen when cultures come together.Do you enjoy pizza? What is the strangest topping you have ever had on a pizza? Tell us about your experiences.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine it is a hot summer day. The sun burns down on your skin. You have been working hard. You just want a break. You want something cool to eat. What do you choose?Well, millions of people around the world choose ice cream! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the history of this special icy treat.Ice cream is generally a sweetened frozen food. It is usually made from cream, sugar, eggs, and different flavors. However, there are many different ways to make ice cream. No one knows exactly who invented ice cream. But there are many stories about how it began.A version of ice cream may have begun in Persia more than 2,500 years ago. And some stories say that Nero enjoyed ice cream in ancient Rome. They say Emperor Nero would send servants to get ice from the mountains. Then he would cover it in fruit juices and .The kind of ice cream we eat today may have been invented in China. The Tang period in China was between 600 and 900 AD. During this period, people brought ice cream treats to the ruler. They heated buffalo, cow and goat milk together. After a time, the mix became thick like yogurt. They added flour to the mix. And they put camphor in it for flavor. They cooled the mix in icy water. Then they served it to the Emperor.Marco Polo was an Italian explorer. He traveled to many parts of the world as a merchant. When he visited China, he tried many of these ice treats. He even learned how to make some of them. Then, when he returned, he made these iced treats for his family and friends.Around this time there were also simple treats that were more like sorbet. Sorbet is an icy treat made with ice, sugar and fruit or fruit juice.All of these ice cream treats became very popular in France in the 1500s. And it was not too long before they became popular all around the world. Over time, ice cream changed and developed in different ways.As you have heard, ice cream was first enjoyed only by the rich. This was because keeping food at such a cold temperature or getting ice from a mountain top cost a lot of money. But, over time, the methods for freezing improved. And more and more people had the money and resources to buy ice cream and keep it cold.Today, People all over the world enjoy ice cream. Some studies say that New Zealand eats the most ice cream in the world per person. But other countries eat almost as much, including Australia, Finland, the United States, China and India.Ice cream is a big business in many parts of the world. In 2016, researchers estimated that this industry was worth over 68 million dollars US. And it is only getting bigger. Growing markets like Brazil, China, and India are buying more ice cream. Experts estimate that by 2023, the ice cream industry will be worth over 97 million dollars US.Some studies even suggest that the 2020 pandemic increased ice cream sales even more! They suggest that people were looking for delicious food that made them feel happy. That is ice cream!So what kinds of ice cream are these people eating? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the different kinds of ice cream around the world.Italy serves an ice cream called gelato. Italians make gelato with milk, water and different flavors. But gelato is a little different from ice cream. There is not as much air in gelato. Gelato is much thicker than normal ice cream. A person can eat smaller amounts because it is so filling and sweet.In India, a popular treat similar to ice cream is called kulfi. Kulfi has more ice in it than other ice creams. It is not as smooth. Indians flavor kulfi with foods like pistachio nuts or cardamom spice.In , people eat mochi ice cream. First, people shape the ice cream into small, round balls. Then they cover these balls with mochi. Mochi is a kind of sticky rice.Some places even have a special ice cream they are famous for. In Ecuador there is a town called Salcedo. In Salcedo they serve ice cream on a stick. They freeze the ice cream in different layers, or parts. Each layer is a different color. So, the ice cream almost looks like a rainbow. There are four layers. Three are made from local fruits. And there is a top layer made of thick, sweet cream. When you drive into Salcedo you can even see a large statue of this ice cream treat!Ice cream is also a great treat because you can make it yourself! You can make your own ice cream at home with only a few simple ingredients. This ice cream looks a little different from the ice cream you buy in a store. It is softer, but it still tastes good. Here is how you make it. You can also find this recipe on our website.To make this ice cream you need two zippered plastic bags \u2013 one large and one small. Fill the large bag halfway with ice and rock salt. Leave enough room in the large bag to fit the smaller bag inside. Then, in the small bag, combine milk or cream and a small amount of sugar. You can also add another flavor, like vanilla or honey. Take all of the air out of the small bag. And make sure you close the bag very tightly! Then put it inside the large bag of ice and salt. Here comes the fun part. Close the large bag, too. Then, shake shake shake! You must shake the two bags together for five to ten minutes. After it becomes harder, remove the bag of milk and sugar. It should now be ice cream. Now enjoy!What kind of ice cream is common in your country? What is your favorite kind of ice cream? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting.\u00a0It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It has been a long day. You have worked very hard. Now, you are sitting down to your dinner. Tonight you will have chicken and rice. You eat the good tasting meal, and even eat a little more. You go to bed happy. But a few hours later, you do not feel so well. In fact, you run to the toilet quickly. You vomit \u2013 your food is coming back up your throat! Your stomach feels terrible and it is making loud sounds. But that is not all! You have a fever. And your head and whole body also hurt. What happened to you? Could it have been your good-tasting meal? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on food safety.Food safety is a problem in all places around the world \u2013 in developing and developed countries. The WHO says that millions of people get sick every year from unsafe food. More than 2,000,000 of these people will even die from these sicknesses.A few years ago the WHO released a set of educational materials about food safety. They were five simple rules for preparing food in a safe way. They call these rules the \u201cFive Keys to Safer Food\u201d. People usually use keys to open things that are locked, like doors. But these keys aim to open the way to safer food.People in different areas of the world prepare foods in different ways. People eat different kinds of foods. Some people do not have enough money to buy refrigerators, cleaning materials or good cooking equipment. Some may not be able to get clean water. But the WHO believes that these five keys can still help to inform all people about disease that can come from food or water. Most of us prepare food at some time, and all of us eat it!So what are these five simple rules? Here are the WHO\u2019s five keys to safer food. The first key tells about the importance of washing.\u00a0 People should wash their hands often \u2013 before touching food, while they are preparing food, and any time after they go to the toilet. People should wash all surfaces and equipment used for preparing food. People should also protect cooking areas and food from insects and animals.Keeping everything clean helps people to avoid micro-organisms. Micro-organisms are very small living cells such as bacteria or viruses. They are so small that we cannot see them. But some of them can cause disease.\u00a0 Many dangerous micro-organisms live in soil, unclean water, animals and people.\u00a0They can also live where we make food, especially if the places are dirty. Micro-organisms can move from one surface to another surface very quickly and easily.\u00a0 Even a small touch can pass dangerous micro-organisms onto our hands, clothes, cooking tools, and cutting surfaces.\u00a0 But if we keep everything clean, the micro-organisms do not get a chance to spread. People should separate raw, or uncooked food from foods that are already cooked and foods that will not be cooked. People should store raw meat, chicken, and fish in containers, or in separate areas. Raw foods should not touch prepared foods. The WHO also says that people should use separate equipment and tools for touching and preparing raw foods. For example, if a person uses a knife to cut raw chicken, he should not use that same knife to cut a cooked piece of chicken. He should wash the knife, or use a different knife.Raw meat and the liquid inside it often hide dangerous micro-organisms.\u00a0 So if raw meat touches other food the micro-organisms could spread.People should cook eggs and meat, like birds, seafood, and animals, especially carefully.\u00a0 These foods may carry more micro-organisms than other foods. When meat is fully cooked the liquid from it will be clear, and not pink or red. People should boil food with a lot of liquid, such as soup, for at least a minute. That way, the pieces of meat and vegetables in the soup will be cooked completely. It is also important that people re-heat cooked food completely.When food is completely cooked, the micro-organisms inside it die. Then the food is safe to eat. The WHO says that heating foods to 70 degrees Celsius makes sure they are safe. Thick pieces of meat like whole birds, must reach 70 degrees even in the middle. A thermometer can be very helpful to make sure that the food reaches the correct cooking temperature. People should eat cooked food immediately, while it is still hot. It should be above 60 degrees Celsius if possible. And food should not stay out for longer than two hours. When people are finished eating, they should keep the food that is left cold. The food should be stored in a refrigerator, or electric cooling device, below five degrees Celsius. And people must not store food for too long in the refrigerator.At room temperature, about 20 degrees, the amount of micro-organisms can increase very quickly.\u00a0 But temperatures above 60 degrees or below five degrees control the growth of micro-organisms. They cannot grow as quickly in a very hot or very cold environment.People should use safe water or treat the water to make it safe. People should choose fresh foods. They should wash any fruits or vegetables in clean water, especially if they do not plan to cook them. The WHO says that people should choose foods that have gone through special processes to make them safe.\u00a0 For example, pasteurization is a process that destroys many harmful micro-organisms. Milk is often pasteurized to make it safe.Many dangerous micro-organisms and chemicals can live in places that people may not expect. Water and ice can look clean, but may still contain dangerous micro-organisms.\u00a0 Damaged or old food may develop harmful chemicals called toxins as it gets older. In some cases, these toxins can cause death. This key also says that washing and taking the skin off vegetables can also reduce the risk of harm from micro-organisms.These are the WHO\u2019s five keys to safer food. Today, these materials are translated into 68 languages. Programs that encourage health use the five keys in over 100 different countries. People can use these materials to train anyone who prepares food.There is much more information about food safety on the WHO\u2019s website. You can find a link to the WHO\u2019s Five keys to safer food on the script page of this program. You can also see if the materials have been translated into your language!The writer and producer of this program was Liz Waid. You can find our programs on the Internet at www.radioenglish.net.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.The Fugu fish is extremely poisonous to humans. Some people say it is hundreds of times more deadly than the poison cyanide. And there is enough poison in one Fugu fish to kill 30 people. Would you want to eat this fish? It can be safe if it is prepared correctly. But if a person eats a piece of incorrectly prepared Fugu fish, he will die.Preparing Fugu is a difficult job. Before a person can prepare Fugu, she spends at least two years studying under a master chef. She must pass a special Fugu test. The test is very difficult. One third of people taking the test fail.Fugu is unsafe to prepare and eat. It costs a lot of money. And it can have a weak taste. But Fugu is very popular. So why would so many people want to eat it?\u00a0 Fugu is taboo.Taboos are very important in any culture. A taboo describes something that is set apart. It is usually something that a person should not do for a particular reason. A taboo food is a food that most people will not eat. But a food that is taboo in one culture may not be taboo in another culture. But what makes food taboo in one culture and acceptable in another? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on foods that are taboo.People have strong opinions about what is good to eat and what is not. Fugu comes from Japan, but food taboos exist all around the world. For example, in many countries, people do not eat dogs. This is because people keep dogs as pets \u2013 as their animal friends. But in some countries, eating dog meat is not taboo. For example, in some parts of Asia, people eat dog meat. In these places, eating a dog would not be a taboo.Some food taboos come from religion. What we eat is sometimes connected to what we believe. People eat cows in many parts of the world. But to Hindus in India, cows are taboo. The people there choose not to eat these animals.Some taboos develop out of tradition. Food taboos can celebrate a common history and bring people together. Every February, the people of Iceland hold a celebration, called Thorrablot. This is a celebration of Iceland\u2019s history and culture. And food is an important part of Thorrablot \u2013 especially taboo food. Usually, decaying food is an important taboo. Decayed food can have dangerous bacteria. But at Thorrablot, one of the important foods is called H\u00e1karl. It is a decaying \u2013 or fermented \u2013 shark meat.Sharks are large dangerous fish. Sharks are found in many places around the world. But in Iceland, the sharks contain many particular chemicals to protect them from the freezing water. These chemicals make the shark poisonous to people. So, to eat the shark meat, cooks must use an unusual method.Traditionally, a person removes the shark\u2019s head and insides. They set the shark on sand. Then they cover it with more sand and heavy rocks. This will press the liquids out of the shark\u2019s body. It stays like this for six to 12 weeks. After the shark is cured like this, it is cut into long thin pieces. The pieces hang to dry for a few months. They develop a hard brown outer layer. It also has a particular smell. The shark meat is now fully fermented. The outer layer is cut off and the shark is cut into smaller pieces.People say that when you are going to eat H\u00e1karl, you should not smell it first. That is because the finished H\u00e1karl smells like liquid human waste. But people say it tastes like cheese. Icelandic people say that eating the shark is a way to remember their history and culture. Even today, you can find H\u00e1karl almost anywhere in Iceland \u2014 even in grocery stores.Another reason people eat taboo foods is because they believe the foods will give them health benefits. For example, in Asian countries, some people eat the male sex organ of a bull, a male cow. This food taboo has a special effect. People believe it will give them a strong desire for sex. This thinking is not always based on modern medicine. Instead, it is part of a long tradition that connects eating well to good health. After all, food was the first medicine.Not all food taboos have a tradition that goes back many hundred years. Until 1947, India was under British rule. During this time, children with one British parent and one Indian parent were rejected by both cultures. These rejected people formed a separate culture. It has its own rules about food. One special food is kutti pi.Kutti pi is made from a taboo food \u2013 a fetus. A fetus is an unborn animal, taken from the body of its mother. Usually, people make kutti pi using a goat fetus. But people do not eat kutti pi often. It can only be made when a pregnant animal is killed. This food is so taboo that sometimes meat sellers will not admit to selling it. They will only deliver it in secret.Food is important to us. It is easy to react to taboo foods with emotion. New or strange foods may be the most difficult thing to accept about a new culture. When we hear what other people eat, it is easy to judge them. It is easy to believe that since they eat strange things, they must be strange people.But, we can remember that what people do is more important than what they eat. How people love is more important than what they cook. And the food they put in their mouth is not as important as the words that come out.Would you eat kutti pi? What about decaying shark meat?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A small group of people sit in silence. Their eyes are fixed on the movement of one woman \u2013 Sachiko. Sachiko is a small Japanese woman. She wears traditional Japanese clothes \u2013 a beautiful kimono. She is busy preparing a green tea. She concentrates on each of her movements. Each movement flows into the next. What is she doing? She is leading, or hosting, a Japanese tea ceremony. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Japanese tea ceremony.In Japan, drinking  is very popular. Originally, people drank tea as a form of medicine. Soon they drank it because they enjoyed it. At first, black tea was the most popular. But in the 12th century this changed. The people used a different kind of tea \u2013 green tea, or \u2018matcha\u2019.Both green and black teas come from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant. People put the plant leaves in the sun to dry them. Black tea is dried in the sun for a longer time. The leaves react with the oxygen in the air and turn black. But to make green tea, people gently steam the leaves before drying. This way the leaves keep their green colour.The Japanese tea ceremony developed over many years. But during the 16th century the ceremony became an art form called wabi cha. One of the people who influenced this art was the great \u2018tea master\u2019 Sen no Rikyu. He believed in the importance of peace, respect, purity and calmness. He combined this simple, everyday part of life with his spiritual beliefs. These are now called, \u2018Sado\u2019 \u2013 the way of tea.Sachiko is a young Japanese woman. She has studied the tea ceremony for many years. She describes what the tea ceremony means to her.\u2018For me, the tea ceremony is like learning about life, how I live, and how do I see myself in this life. And my tea master will teach me history of the tea ceremony and teach me about movements or flower arrangement or utensil or pottery or any sort of thing. The tea ceremony takes normally about three hours.\u2019It takes many years to perform the art of a tea ceremony perfectly. Like Sachiko, students do not just learn about tea. They must also learn other traditions \u2013 such as Japanese writing and flower organising. At official tea ceremonies, even the people who attend must know some things about \u2018Sado\u2019. They must know the right ways to move \u2013 such as how to drink the tea. They must know when to speak and what to say.In most  ceremonies, a host will invite four people. They are guests of the ceremony. The host\u2019s helper leads these people into a waiting room. The helper offers sayu to drink. This is hot water for tea-making. At the right time, the helper leads the people to the tea room, or chashitsu. This special room is only for tea ceremonies. Tea rooms are usually inside a teahouse. Teahouses are usually outside, in the garden.Before the host receives her guests she fills the stone basin with water. She washes her hands and mouth. She walks to the middle gate. Here, she welcomes her guests with a bow. No one speaks. The host leads the guests through the gate. Then, they too wash at the stone basin. They are then ready to enter the teahouse.They enter the teahouse through a sliding door. The door is just under a metre high. Everyone must bow to go through. This is an important act. It is a sign of equality. When people are through the door they become equal. They lose their social position.The tea room is simple. It usually has a hanging piece of material. This has Japanese writing on it. It may include words that show the values of the tea ceremony \u2013 like peace, respect, purity and calmness. The room also usually contains flowers.The guests bend down on their knees. And they wait for the host to serve them. They leave their worries behind them. They centre their minds only on the room. Hosts may serve the guests sweets called higashi.The host then organises the tea instruments. She cleans them with water. She dries them with a fine cloth. Then, she places three scoops of tea for each guest into the tea bowl, or chawan. She puts the right amount of water into the chawan. And then she mixes it using a chasen. She needs skill to mix the powdered tea in the correct way \u2013 to make it become a thick liquid. Then she bows. She lifts the chawan with her right hand. And she places it on her left hand. She turns the chawan to the right three times, using her right hand.The host then passes the chawan to one of the guests. He bows and accepts the bowl. After he drinks from it, he cleans the top. Then he passes it to the next guest with his right hand. The guest turns the chawan and drinks from it in the same way. Guests look at the bowl before they drink from it. They see its beauty. During the whole ceremony the host serves the guests.Each instrument and movement is important in the ceremony. Buddhist theology influences much of these movements, positions and instruments. However, you do not have to be a Buddhist to take part in a tea ceremony. Some people take part in the ceremony simply to enjoy the social gathering. Others take part to enjoy the peace and calmness of the ceremony.The way of the tea has four main teachings: Wa means harmony or peace. People must try and be at peace with everything in their life \u2013 people and nature.Kei means respect. People must respect everything around them.Sei means purity. People must try to act purely.Jaku means peace of mind. It is these values that tea masters spend years trying to learn through sado \u2013 way of the tea.Would you like a Japanese tea ceremony?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Luke Haley. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In 1819, a young German doctor discovered a drug. The doctor\u2019s name was Friedlieb Ferdinand Lunge. A friend had given Lunge some coffee beans to study. They were small and dark brown. As he tested the beans he discovered a chemical inside them: caffeine. Today, caffeine is the most used drug in the world. Many people depend on caffeine to help them start the day. And more and more products contain caffeine. But there are negative results from using too much caffeine. How much is too much? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on caffeine.Caffeine is a drug that naturally exists in some foods. It is found in coffee beans, cocoa beans, guarana, yerba mat\u00e9, tea and other plants. Through history, people from all over the world have grown and used plants for the effect of caffeine. But today, people commonly get caffeine through coffee, , or soft drinks like .In a plant, caffeine is a natural pesticide \u2013 it makes insects unable to move and then kills them. But in a person\u2019s body caffeine acts very differently. It speeds up a person\u2019s central nervous system, inside the body. It stimulates the brain \u2013 that is, it makes a brain act and react faster. Some people feel that they can be more creative when they drink caffeine. It makes people feel more awake. And it can also increase physical performance in sports.Caffeine affects a person quickly. Imagine a person who is drinking a cup of coffee. The drug begins to affect him about five minutes after he starts drinking it. In 30 minutes, the caffeine affects the person most strongly. After about four and a half hours, his body has used about half the amount of caffeine. And by the next day, the caffeine is gone. Caffeine does not stay in the body.Many people begin their day with caffeine in coffee or tea. Spotlight writer Christy VanArragon drinks coffee every morning. But is it a good thing? She says:\u201cCoffee makes me feel more awake and it helps me concentrate. But when I forget to drink it, I get painful headaches. And when I drink too much, my hands shake, and I talk really fast! Coffee is great most of the time, but it also causes some problems.\u201dThese effects can be common for people who drink caffeine. In fact, people can come to depend on caffeine. People who try to stop drinking caffeine may be very tired, have muscle pains, or even have stomach pain. But these symptoms usually stop in about a week. Too much caffeine can also cause problems. People who have had too much caffeine may have head pain or stomach pain. They may have a rapid heartbeat. They may feel anxious, worried or nervous. Too much caffeine can make a person . But there are also more serious effects when people take extremely high amounts. These effects include a feeling of not knowing where you are, body movements you cannot control, or even death.In the United States and the United Kingdom, health experts have set a safe level of caffeine a person can take. They advise that people do not take more than 400 milligrams of caffeine in a day. That is equal to about four to five cups of coffee. Many experts believe this amount is safe for an adult. Murray Carpenter wrote a book about caffeine. He told news organisation NPR:\u201cFor people who are using caffeine moderately, it is probably perfectly healthy. And we know there are some signs that we may even get some good effects out of long-term coffee drinking.\u201dResearchers cannot agree if caffeine is good for people or bad for them. Caffeine does have some bad effects. But, like Carpenter says, caffeine also has some good effects. Research shows that drinking coffee and tea with caffeine may reduce the risks of some kinds of cancer. It can reduce a person\u2019s risk of getting type two diabetes. And even though it increases blood pressure and a person\u2019s heart rate, it does not seem to cause problems with a person\u2019s heart. But these good effects do not come from drinking caffeine in soft drinks \u2013 just drinks like coffee and tea.All of this information may make a person wonder what to do! But it gets worse. That is because recently, companies have been adding caffeine to more and more drinks and food. People may not know how much caffeine they are taking.The FDA is a government agency in the United States. It sets safety rules for food and drugs there. In 2013, the FDA began investigating caffeine. They were looking particularly at caffeine in energy drinks and food. Michael R. Taylor works at the FDA. He told about a new chewing gum containing caffeine. Each stick of gum contains caffeine. He explained how products like these can be harmful for young adults and children.\u201cThe gum is just one more sad example of the movement to add caffeine to food. Our concern is about caffeine appearing in many new products. This includes products that may look good to children and young adults\u2026 One package of this gum is like having four cups of coffee with you\u2026 The large number of these products in the marketplace worries us.\u201dCompanies are putting caffeine in products that young adults and even children may want to try. Many government organizations and health experts are working to regulate caffeine. They want to make rules about what products can contain caffeine, and how much caffeine those products can use. However, it is not an easy job. Stephen Braun wrote a book about caffeine. He told the BBC:\u201cOne problem with trying to regulate the substance is that it affects everyone differently. People have different bodies and different ways of processing food. It is impossible to say what a \u201csafe\u201d limit is for everyone. Ultimately, you have to be your own scientist. There is no other good method than carefully experimenting on yourself.\u201dIt is important for a person to know how much caffeine he is getting through drinks and food. But it is also important for him to know how caffeine affects his body. A person should know what his body can manage.What about you? Do you use caffeine?

I\u2019m Rena Dam.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine a family with three children. Maria is the oldest, David is the second child and Tom is the youngest. One day, their father told them some bad news \u2013 he lost his job. Maria was worried. She told her father that she would work to make money for the family. David put his arms around his father and told him that everything would be fine. Tom was sad \u2013 his father had promised him new shoes for football. How would he get them now?Why did Maria, David and Tom all react differently to their father\u2019s news? Why are children from the same family often so different from one another?\u00a0 Dr. Alfred Adler had a theory about this. He worked as a doctor in Austria one hundred years ago. He was very interested in the qualities of a person\u2019s character or personality. Dr. Adler thought that the order that children were born into their families affected their personalities. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Adler\u2019s birth order theory.There are four possible birth order positions within a family. A child may be the oldest, the youngest or the middle child. Other families have only one child with no brothers or sisters. Birth order theory says that our birth order influences what kind of person we each become.Frank Sulloway is a writer and family expert at the University of Calfornia, Berkeley. He believes that birth order affects personality and behavior. He talked to TIME magazine about it. He said that people develop this way for reasons of survival. If a family has more than one child, the children must compete for the parents\u2019 time and resources \u2013 resources like food. Frank Sulloway says that people may not recognize that they are working for survival. But it is part of our natural desires. Sulloway says:\u201c are much smarter than scientists. They are always trying to define their place in the family. They try to get the most resources out of their parents.\u201dChildren in each birth position have a different way to gain an advantage in the family. Here are some of the main characters of personality by birth order:The first born or oldest child often gets more time with her parents. Think about our story from the beginning of this program. When Maria was born, she had no other siblings to compete for food or time. A first born child, like Maria, often wants to please her parents. She often takes control and responsibility in social situations. She may try to be perfect and do everything correctly. Jeffrey Kluger is a writer. He wrote a book about brothers and sisters. He described the character of an oldest child to the news station NPR:\u201cIt is often true that oldest children will be the most successful. They will be the ones who earn the most. They will be the ones who are most loyal to the family, most driven to achieve in traditional ways. They will also be the tallest, even if it is only by a few centimeters. They often have higher tested intelligence than the second-born.\u201dThe last born or youngest child, like Tom, is used to other people providing for him. He may be more concerned about himself than about other people. But Tom is also very friendly. He likes to make other people laugh with jokes and funny behavior. As the youngest, this is often the best way for him to get other people to notice him.David is an example of a middle child. He can sometimes feel left out. He does not get the advantages of being the oldest or the youngest. The middle child often develops skills in the arts, such as music or painting. Some middle children become competitive and even rebel against their parents. But many of them, like David, make peace in the family. As a middle child David has learned to work well with other people.The last birth order position is the only child. With no brothers or sisters she often gets whatever she wants! She does not have any competition for her parents\u2019 time or resources. The only child often uses language very well because she spends so much time with adults. She can also feel a lot of pressure as the only child. This can make her competitive and hard-working.Do these personalities fit you and your family? Some people find that birth order theory describes them very well. Other people say the theory cannot be tested and does not work. There are many other variables or different situations that may change the effects of birth order on personality.These variables include the sex and age of each child and the number of brothers and sisters. Culture and education also make a difference. So does the amount of money that the family has. The experiences of the family can also change how birth order affects personality. For example, some children are adopted, not born into, their family. Families also change as a result of sickness, death or divorce of the parents.Some children may also need different treatment because of disabilities or medical needs \u2013 and this can affect the other children in the family. Dianna Anderson, a producer for Spotlight, gives an example. She has two older brothers, and one is disabled. Dianna says,\u201cBirth order is very different in my family. Because my oldest brother is disabled, my middle brother is much more like a first child. I am in between a middle child and a youngest child. My middle brother is very smart and is very serious about his work. I work very hard too but I also love to make people laugh. Having a disabled first child changed how our parents treated the rest of their children.\u201dThere are many different variables that influence people\u2019s personalities and actions. Birth order is just one interesting theory. And, as Frank Sullaway told ABC news:\u201cHumans are complex. You can find things that are more important than birth order. But that does not mean that birth order is not something we can learn from.\u201dHas birth order affected your personality? We want to hear your family stories!

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.While in Mexico City, Mexico, you might stop and buy a sweet, fried, churro. On Cheju Island in Korea, you might order some freshly caught fish, called hwae. In Bangkok, , you might need a drink. So you might buy a coconut fruit. You can use a thin straw to drink the liquid from inside it. In Chicago, in the United States, you might want to have a steamed hot dog.Warning! This program may make you hungry! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on street food. Today we travel around the world. We look at the different kinds of foods people can eat on the street.People everywhere in the world love eating street food. But what is it? Street food can be food or drink. It can be fruits or vegetables. Or it could be something cooked like rice or meat, and more! It can be a person\u2019s whole meal, or just a small snack. A vendor sells the food from a cart that can move, or from a stall \u2013 a small sheltered area. Vendors usually only sell one kind of food. And prices of street food are usually low.There are a few reasons why street food is so great. First, street food is easy to get. People who are hurrying somewhere can buy street food quickly. Vendors often have the food fully prepared.Second, street food does not cost a lot of money. Very poor people can still buy street food. And a street food meal can include many healthy substances.Finally, there is one more reason street food is so great \u2013 and you may already know it. Street food is ! It tastes very good! And many of our listeners would agree! We asked Spotlight listeners to share some of their favorite street foods. People from all over the world answered.Erioni from Albania wrote that she liked pies, burgers and hotdogs. Hot dogs were also Joel\u2019s favorite food in the United States. In Uganda, Muhwezi and Bamutengire liked fruits and apples. And Sky and Tinah both liked Rolex. This is a thin bread surrounding egg and vegetables. Trinh from Vietnam simply answered \u201crice\u201d. In Indonesia, Agustinus likes to order sego kucing. This is made with rice with things on top \u2013 like dried fish. Then it is wrapped in banana fruit leaves. And Ying-ying from the Philippines could not name just one favorite street food! She named fish balls, quail eggs, squid balls and barbeque.Travel writers have also written lists of the best street food around the world. Travel with us as we taste the different street foods of the world!Mexico City, Mexico. Churros are one favorite food here. These are tubes of fried bread dough. The vendor fries the dough, or uncooked bread. Then he shakes cinnamon spice and sugar over it. It is a sweet snack!\u00a0 Another famous Mexican street food is Elote. This food uses corn on the cob. That is, the corn is freshly picked from the plant. Then, the vendor takes the rough covering off the corn. He pushes a wooden stick through the corn cob. He cooks the corn over a fire. Then, he covers the corn with a good tasting mayonnaise sauce. He puts spicy chilli flakes and cheese on the corn. Finally, he squeezes a sour lime fruit over it.Ho Chi Minh City, . Here, the most famous street food sandwich is called Banh mi. This sandwich is on long bread with a thick crust. Inside is meat and pickled vegetables. JJ Goode writes for the travel website concierge.com. He describes biting into this delicious sandwich:\u201cYour teeth crash through the bread and into still-warm pieces of grilled pork. Then you taste crunchy cucumber, sweet-tangy pieces of pickled carrot and daikon and cilantro. It has just a bit of Vietnamese mayo. You should add a small amount of hot sauce. This may be the best sandwich you have ever had.\u201dBerlin, Germany. You may be surprised to learn that Berlin has a very big Turkish population. So the street food here has a Turkish influence. One of these foods is called currywurst. Currywurst is a long thin piece of meat. The vendor cuts the meat into smaller pieces. Then she puts a special curry sauce on top of it. The sauce is made of curry spice and tomato sauces. People eat currywurst from paper plates with very small forks.Marrakech, Morocco. Marrakech\u2019s main square contains hundreds of different food stalls. But everyone here knows one street food: harira soup. This liquid soup is a traditional food. A vendor makes it from good-tasting liquid broth, beans, onions, turmeric spice, and the cilantro plant. People eat the soup with a small wood spoon.Mumbai, India. Bhel puri is a low-fat and good-tasting food that contains many vegetables. It is made with a plate full of puffed rice. This is a bigger form of rice. It crunches in your mouth. A vendor adds many different things on top. He may add potato, red onion, and cilantro. Then he adds a spicy tamarind sauce on top. The sauce is also tangy \u2013 it makes a person\u2019s mouth water. The sauce makes some of the rice more soft. Bhel puri is spicy, tangy, crunchy and soft \u2013 a wonderful and interesting food!These are just a few kinds of street food. But there are many more kinds all around the world. It is easy to see why so many people around the world eat it!But there are some concerns about street food. People can get sick from street food. Vendors may work in unclean conditions. This means that people who eat street food may suffer from sicknesses like diarrhea or vomiting. People can even die from these sicknesses. But governments and health organizations also work with street vendors to improve the quality of street food.If you love street food, you do not have to be afraid of eating it. Streetfood.org just suggests making wise decisions when you want to eat. Look for a vendor in a clean area. Are his hands clean? Is he wearing clean clothes? Is there a place for the vendor to wash dishes, and a separate area to wash hands? Finally, look at the food. Does it look fully cooked? Does it smell good or bad? If it smells bad, it is probably not safe.Tell us about street food where you live! You can leave a comment on the script page for this program.The writer and producer of this program was Liz Waid.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Marina Cantacuzino is a news writer.\u00a0In 2003, she started a project that changed her life.\u00a0For many months, Marina worked with an artist named Brian Moody.\u00a0Together, they met with individuals that had been affected by crime. Some of the people were victims of crimes. Other people were criminals. Brian took pictures of each person. Marina asked each person to tell their story. These stories were about terrible pain, loss, and regret.\u00a0But they were also about forgiveness.Marina and Brian gathered these stories and pictures together.\u00a0With them, they created an exhibit or public art show. They called the exhibit \u201cThe F Word.\u201d It used the words and images of the people to show that forgiveness is complex. This exhibit led Marina to start an organization called \u201cThe Forgiveness Project.\u201d Today\u2019s Spotlight is on The Forgiveness Project and the power of spreading forgiveness around the world.In 2004, The F Word exhibit opened in London, England.\u00a0Many people came and saw it. Soon, other cities wanted to show the exhibit too.\u00a0 So, the exhibit started travelling around the world. People in over 350 places saw The F Word show.\u00a0Marina wrote about two main ways people reacted to the exhibit.\u201cThere are people who see forgiveness as a very honorable and humble way to react to terrible events. And then there are those who simply laugh at it. For the first group, forgiveness is a strong value. It is strong enough to end generations of trouble caused by revenge \u2013 when people choose to hurt those who hurt them.\u00a0But for the second group, forgiveness is just a weak answer. This group feels that forgiveness lets the violator go free and only encourages more violence.\u201dMarina learned a lot about forgiveness through her work on the exhibit.\u00a0She discovered that forgiving is not easy for anyone. Talking about forgiveness causes strong  \u2013 both in people who choose to forgive and in people who do not forgive. Marina saw that forgiveness was a process that only worked if people freely chose it.\u00a0 She also recognized that it had the power to transform or completely change difficult situations.\u00a0 This power and the popularity of the exhibit caused Marina to start The Forgiveness Project.The goal of The Forgiveness Project is \u201cto build a better future by healing the wounds of the past\u201d.\u00a0 They do this by encouraging discussion and education about forgiveness.\u00a0They also work to spread positive stories of forgiveness.One part of the project is its prison program.\u00a0This program is designed to teach prisoners about forgiveness and help keep them from doing more crimes in the future.\u00a0The Forgiveness Project also works in schools.\u00a0It provides materials that help students explore ideas about forgiveness.\u00a0 It also teaches students about conflict resolution.The Forgiveness Project also has a special place on its website where it collects stories from men and women all over the world. This collection of stories shows how complex forgiveness is. For example, consider the stories of Tracey Ford and Mariane Pearl.Tracey Ford believes in forgiveness \u2013 even in the worst situations. And in 2007 her belief was tested.\u00a0Her son Andre was 17. He went to a friend\u2019s birthday party.\u00a0When he was there, criminals shot guns at the party crowd.\u00a0They shot Andre two times and murdered him.\u00a0The police did not find the people who killed Andre.\u00a0And yet, Tracey says she forgives the people who killed her son.\u00a0She told The Forgiveness Project:\u201cForgiveness is not saying that what happened was okay. It is being able to say in your heart that you accept what has happened. And you will not let it stop you living a life or seeing humanity in the person who has hurt you.\u201dBut Mariane Pearl feels differently about forgiveness.\u00a0Mariane lived in Pakistan with her husband. In 2002, her husband was murdered by a terrorist group. She told The Forgiveness Project that she could not forgive her husband\u2019s killer.\u00a0But she also did not want revenge.\u00a0She did not want to hurt him in return.\u00a0Instead, she wanted the court system to provide justice.\u00a0She describes her feelings on The Forgiveness Project website.\u201cRevenge is a basic human desire. It is the animal part of man. It gets us nowhere\u2026 But forgiveness lacks substance as an answer to extreme situations\u2026You have to win some sort of victory over the people who have hurt you. You can only do that by denying the terrorists their goal.\u00a0They try to kill everything in you\u2026 The only way to oppose them is by demonstrating the strength they think they have taken from you. That strength is to keep on living, to keep on valuing life.\u201dAs Mariane\u2019s story demonstrates, it is difficult to talk about forgiveness without talking about justice. So, The Forgiveness Project encourages people to seek restorative justice. This kind of justice works to build relationships between victims and the criminals who hurt them.\u00a0 Restorative justice also identifies ways to repair harm when possible. Matthew James\u2019 story is a good example of restorative justice.Matthew is from England. One day, while Matthew was at work, someone entered his house.\u00a0This person stole his things and left.\u00a0Matthew was angry.\u00a0A few weeks later, the same robber can back to Matthew\u2019s home.\u00a0Now Matthew felt unsafe. He felt like he could not protect himself or his girlfriend.\u00a0After a month, the police arrested the man who entered Matthew\u2019s house.\u00a0His name was Billy.Soon after, a police officer invited Matthew to meet Billy.\u00a0Matthew decided to go to the prison and talk with Billy.\u00a0But he was not the only person there.\u00a0Other victims Billy hurt were there too. Billy told Matthew and the others about his past.\u00a0Then, the victims talked about how they were hurt by Billy\u2019s actions. Matthew saw a change in Billy. Billy could now see how his actions had hurt real people like Matthew. Matthew told The Forgiveness Project,\u201cWhen I left the prison I recognized that things had changed for me. I changed from being a victim of crime to being able to see things from Billy\u2019s side. Some kind of balance had returned.\u201dForgiveness looks different in every situation.\u00a0For some people, it requires justice. For others, it is a process of grace. Some people can only forgive if the criminal shows regret for his actions. Others can forgive without even knowing the criminal. For some it means every day deciding to forgive again. Even though people may experience and describe forgiveness differently, Marina Cantacuzino believes it always has power. She writes,\u201cForgiveness is difficult, costly and painful. But it has the possible ability to completely change a person.\u201dThe writer of this program was Courtney Schutt.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.As humans, we do some strange things. We jump out of airplanes. We make enough bombs to blow up the whole world. We invent sports and then spend much of our lives playing or watching them. We cry during sad films even though we know the actors are not really dying. But it can be the small, common things humans do that are really the most strange.For example, two people are in love. They like to spend time together. They feel good when they are together. They share many interests. They have similar goals for the future. But here is the strange thing. One way they show each other love is to take their mouths and press them together. They may even put their tongues into each other\u2019s mouth! They may even do this for a long time. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on kissing!What is a ? Have you ever thought about it? Have you thought about all the different kisses you might give, or someone might give you?There are three main kinds of kisses. First, there are kisses between parents and children. Kisses for children should be short, non-sexual, and on appropriate places like heads and hands. These kisses help children understand they are special and loved.Second, there are kisses of greeting. These kinds of kisses are different from country to country. They are governed by the rules of that culture. For example, in Argentina, when two people meet, they give each other a kiss on the right side of the face \u2014 the cheek. But it is usually not a real kiss. The cheeks touch and they make a small kissing sound. No lips or mouths touch at all.In some places of Italy, people greet with not one, but two cheek kisses. They first kiss one side. Then they kiss the other side. In the Netherlands, people kiss three times: first one side, then the other, then back to the first side. And some places have even more complex rules about greeting kisses. People in many countries in the Middle East greet each other with a kiss. But this is not appropriate between everyone. An unmarried man and unmarried woman should not kiss. So what do you do if you are travelling and don\u2019t know what to do? A good rule is: if you do not know what to do, do not kiss.But there is one more kind of . And it is far more complex than the first two. The third kind of kiss is the romantic kiss. But what is romantic about it? Noam Shpancer teaches psychology at Otterbein University. In Psychology Today, he wrote,\u201cOne must admit that kissing is more than a bit strange. Why would the exchange of mouth fluids and left over pieces of food be a good thing, even a sign of passionate love? The romantic kiss is very common. So it must play an important part in the dance of human sexuality. But what exactly is that part?\u201dScientists do not agree about why people kiss when they are in love. But there are many ideas. The first idea is that kissing helps us understand other people in a chemical way. When we kiss someone we get close to them. We smell their body and their breath. We taste their mouth. We feel their face. The fluids in their mouth carry chemical signals that may communicate to our brain if they are a good mate.Most animals do not kiss. But they are much better at smelling things than humans. Humans need to be much closer to each other to smell. Melissa Hogenboom wrote for BBC.com,\u201cHumans have a terrible sense of smell. We learn a lot from getting close. Smell is not the only way we measure someone as a mate. But studies have shown that smell is an important part in choosing a mate.\u201dWhen we kiss another person, we bring them close to us. We show them that we trust them. We accept any sickness they may have. A kiss creates closeness between people. Shpancer explains this.\u201cKissing appears to have two main uses. In the short-term, the kiss is more sexual. It serves as a tool for choosing a good sexual partner. In the long-term the kiss expresses a connection between people. It is a way to keep and build feelings of closeness in the relationship.\u201dBut not everyone likes kissing. For some people, this is a personal choice. Some people do not like to be touched. They do not like the idea of sharing mouth fluids with another person. There are also general differences between men and women. Men may think kissing should lead to sex. Women are more likely to think kissing is a way to connect with another person.Kissing is not part of every culture. If you watch films and television, it is easy to believe that romantic kissing is part of life everywhere in the world. But a study published in American Anthropologist shows that kissing is not as common as people may believe. Lindsey Bever wrote about this study for The Washington Post. She wrote,\u201cResearchers at the University of Nevada and Indiana University found fewer than half of the world\u2019s cultures kiss in a romantic way. Many cultures do consider kissing to be a romantic or sexual act. But, other cultures have called kissing \u2018gross\u2019, something to make them sick. They ask why anyone would \u2018share their dinner\u2019.\u201dA kiss means different things to different people. It could be something that is strange and unwelcome. It could mean, \u201cHello, nice to meet you\u201d. Or it could mean, \u201cI love you and want to be with you forever\u201d. But at its most simple, kissing is just one way that some people express their love.What do you think about kissing? Is kissing part of your culture? Tell us what you think.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they liveTwo eyes. One nose. Lips surrounding a mouth. These simple parts help make up one of the most important part of people\u2019s bodies \u2013 the face! You may think your face is just a simple part of your body. But it may be far more important than you think. Do you know what messages your face is sending? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the human face.You are happy! Smile! Now you feel anger. Frown! Point the corners of your mouth down. Make a crease, or line, in the skin above your eyes. By moving your face into these positions, people already know how you feel. You do not even have to say a single word. In fact, some experts believe that your face can produce more than 10,000 different expressions!All these expressions are possible because of the muscles in your face. They form a kind of mask over your skull. They are over your forehead, around your eyes, on your nose, through your cheeks, around your mouth, and down your chin. Your face is covered in muscles! To make an expression, you can move a few muscles at the same time. Or you can move only one muscle. Each combination is a different facial expression.The expressions on your face send a message to the person who is looking at you. Without using words people can understand how you are really feeling. These facial expressions are a form of non-verbal communication. But did you know that your face may also be sending a message even if you do not want it to?The BBC produced a special series of programs about faces called \u201cThe Human Face.\u201d In this program they followed the story of a married couple in England called Eden and Mandy. Eden and Mandy were having a difficult time in their relationship. They fought often. They thought their marriage was probably over! But they decided to try one more thing.Mandy and Eden flew to the United States to meet with Dr. John Gottman. Dr. Gottman is a psychologist, a scientist who studies people. The BBC\u2019s \u201cThe Human Face\u201d program described how Dr. Gottman attached machines to Eden and Mandy. He asked Eden and Mandy to talk to each other. As they talked, Dr. Gottman and his team of scientists observed how Eden and Mandy\u2019s bodies changed while they talked.Dr. Gottman found that arguing was hurting Eden and Mandy\u2019s relationship. But he also believed there was more. Their facial expressions were making things worse! As they fought, Eden and Mandy began to exchange looks of disgust and contempt. These expressions communicate hate and a lack of respect. Eden and Mandy never said they hated each other. But their facial expressions were communicating the message even without words.This might make you think about your own facial expressions. What are you communicating with your face? Can you see what other people are communicating with their faces? Experts say that facial expressions are not always the same between cultures. For example, people in one culture may use their eyes more to communicate a message. They will notice when the eyes are more open or closed. They will notice the lines around the other person\u2019s eyes. Reading a person\u2019s face is something we just do. We do not think about it.However, experts say there are at least seven facial expressions that everyone on earth can recognize. They are universal expressions. These expressions are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, contempt, and disgust. You can probably easily imagine what each of these expressions look like. You do not need language to communicate these feelings \u2013 your face can communicate them for you \u2013 whether you want it to or not!Have you ever been around a baby? If you have, you know that making funny faces will usually make a baby react, and maybe even laugh. Babies love to see different faces. When does this ability to recognize different facial expressions appear?Many scientists have studied how babies react to faces. We do know that babies recognize faces very soon after they are born. In 1974, researchers studied babies who were about nine minutes old. They showed the babies a picture of a face, a picture of shapes, or an empty page. When researchers moved the picture, they observed the babies. Researchers found that babies looked at the picture of a face longer than the other pictures.Even a few hours after they are born, babies will recognize their mother\u2019s face. They will look at their mother\u2019s face longer than they look at another woman\u2019s face. After a few days, babies can see the difference between a sad or happy face. They begin to copy the expression on a face. And around five months later, babies can recognize that a sad voice goes with a sad face.Researchers do not know exactly why or how babies develop these abilities so quickly. It may be that this is an important skill for survival. Babies around eight months old begin to change their behavior based on their mothers\u2019 facial expressions. In one study, researchers looked at one-year-olds. They wanted the babies to walk down a small incline. When the mothers smiled at the babies, the babies walked down the small hill. But when the mothers frowned, the babies did not go down.Our faces communicate a lot of information \u2014 at every age! We can use our faces to give a message. And we can understand what people are thinking just by seeing their face. Researchers try to understand why we need these skills. Some experts say that people who are good at reading faces have a better chance at building relationships, getting a job, and working well with others. That is, our faces help us to be a part of a community. They connect us with other people.Have you ever thought about what your face communicates to others? What does your face show?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In , there is a place with a very strange telephone booth. The small building sits on top of a hill in the middle of a garden. It seems odd there among the  and other plants. It is far from the city, but many people come to use it. People travel here from all over Japan. Years ago, booths like this were common. But there is one thing that makes this booth different. The telephone inside does not work!Local people call this telephone booth kaze no denwa. In English, it means \u201ctelephone of the wind\u201d. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the telephone of the wind.Itaru Sasaki is a retired steel worker. He built the telephone of the wind after his cousin died. He loved his cousin very much. And he was very sad when he died. Sasaki wanted a place to talk to his cousin, even though he was dead. He knew no one could hear him. But he hoped that talking would help him understand his deep sadness. In an interview with the radio program This American Life, Sasaki said,\u201cMy thoughts could not go over regular phone lines. So I wanted them to be carried on the wind.\u201dSasaki placed the telephone in his garden. When he became sad, he would visit the booth. He would talk into the telephone. He would tell his cousin how he felt. It made him feel better.For a time, Sasaki was the only one who visited the telephone booth. But then, something horrible happened. On March 11, 2011, there was an earthquake off the coast of Japan. This was not a normal earthquake. It was one of the most powerful in over a century. The earthquake did a lot of damage in Japan. Even worse, it caused a tsunami \u2013 a huge wave. Tsunamis often begin from very large earthquakes under the water. Japan is an island in an area that has many earthquakes. So there are tsunamis also. The Japanese people thought their country was prepared and ready for any danger. They had built walls, and huge barriers on the coast to stop the damage. But no one alive had seen a wave this big.In March 2011, the tsunami crashed into northern Japan. The water came over the protective walls. It destroyed homes, villages, and cities. The wave also damaged many nuclear power plants. One plant, Fukushima Daiichi, started to leak radiation. Many people who survived the tsunami still had to flee their homes. Even today, these people cannot return. Their homes, and the places they worked, are still full of poisonous radiation. Many thousands of people died in the tsunami. And even more are still missing.The tsunami changed things for Sasaki. He lives in a town called Otsuchi. It is on the north-eastern coast of Japan. The tsunami destroyed most of Otsuchi. Some people tried to rebuild the town. Others just left. Life was not easy for them. Most people of the town knew someone who had died these. And the memories were very painful.Sasaki knew how difficult these feelings were. He saw so many people struggling with their sadness. So he told them about his wind telephone. He let people come into his garden. They would use the telephone of the wind. He even put a notebook inside. Some people did not want to speak. But they could  about their feelings. Only a few people came at first. But soon, more people heard about the telephone. People from all over the country travelled to Sasaki\u2019s garden. Some visited many times. The telephone booth became a special place. People would visit it to remember those they loved.NHK is a Japanese television network. They made a film about the telephone of the wind. The film was called \u201cThe Telephone of the Wind: Whispers to Lost Families.\u201d It was broadcast on the five year anniversary of the Tsunami. NHK recorded several visitors to the telephone. Some do not speak much. Other people speak just about their lives. They talk about their jobs, or their families. There are some people who cry. They express their sadness in the open.In the film, one man walks into the booth. He is a young father. His wife\u2019s name was Mine. His son\u2019s name was Issei. His whole family died in the tsunami. So he is very sad. As he speaks, he begins to cry. He says:\u201cDad? Mom? Mine? Issei? It has already been five years since the tsunami. If my voice reaches you, please listen. I do not know what I am living for. Issei, please let me hear you call me papa. I built a new house. But without all of you, it has no meaning. I want to hear your answer. But I cannot hear anything.\u201dTalking to people who have died is something many people do. Many people honor the memory of people they loved in similar ways. They visit cemeteries and talk at the place where the person is buried. Or they visit special places. This helps them remember the one who died.But the telephone of the wind has become very special to many Japanese people. For many, the places they would visit are gone. The tsunami destroyed these places. The telephone of the wind provides a special place for anyone who wants it. It gives people the chance to express their emotions. It lets them know they are not alone.In the NHK film, a mother and her children visit the telephone booth. The mother lost her husband in the tsunami. She begins to cry in the booth. She is sad that she will never see her husband again. And the booth helps the family to talk about him. As she leaves, the mother tells her children:\u201cWe were all so sad. We did not think we could make it through. And that is why we never talked about Dad until now. But talking to him on the telephone today, it changed something.\u201dHave you ever lost someone you loved? How did you deal with that loss?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A big group can send a big message. But sometimes that message is not a good one. Instead, it is a message of hate. Sometimes people will gather together against others they think are different. They form hate groups. These hate groups sometimes organize crowds of people. They send out information about their gathering, or rally. They meet at a particular time and place. They may bring signs to carry. These signs tell the message of the hate group. Often, these signs insult another particular group of people.Sometimes these rallies become dangerous. People may come to protest the rally. People in the rally and people protesting the rally may begin to fight. Riots may start. Police may try to keep the peace. They arrest people who are fighting. Often, people fighting suffer injuries. News of the hate rally violence spreads. In the end, more people know about the hate rally.But people do want to protest hate rallies. So, how can a person show that he disagrees with hate, or a hate rally? How can a person lead a protest to a hate rally without inciting violence?Today\u2019s Spotlight program is the sixth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate and hate crimes.Hate is a very damaging feeling. It damages the person hating. And it damages the person who is being hated. The Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of  in your community. On today\u2019s Spotlight program we will look at the sixth way to fight hate: Create an Alternative.People faced with hate rallies may feel helpless against such a large hate-filled group. They may feel anger. People may want to show their anger by physically hurting the hate group or causing trouble for them. People protesting hate may want to shout or throw something at the hate group.But violent protests like this do not usually change anything. In fact, protesting a hate group like this can cause more trouble and hate in a community. And violent protests force police to protect everyone at a rally \u2013 even the hate group.The Southern Poverty Law Center has a different idea about what people can do when they are faced with a hate rally. They say that \u201cEvery act of hatred should be met with an act of love and unity.\u201d That is, people can create a sort of balance. When someone does an act of hate, another person can fight it with an act of love.You can do this when you are faced with a hate rally. This is creating an alternative. An alternative is a different thing to choose. For example, one thing you could do is to attend a hate rally to protest it. Or you could choose an alternative. You could choose to protest the hate rally in a different way.So, what could you do as an alternative? Well, the Southern Poverty Law Center suggests holding another event. This other event should be in a different place, but at the same time as the hate rally. You could host, or lead, a picnic, a parade, or a celebration of diversity. Celebrate every kind of culture represented in your community. Include as many different cultures in your celebration as you can. Celebrate the different religions in your community. Include food, music, dancing, and information about the many different kinds of people near you.This will offer other people an alternative too. They can attend your event instead of the hate rally. This will also take away attention from the hate group. And it will help people value each other and all our differences. One town in Maine, in the United States, experienced this kind of alternative. Here is the story.In 2001, Many Somali immigrants came to the town of Lewiston, in the state of Maine. They wanted to improve their quality of life. They did not just want lower cost housing. They wanted good schools. They wanted a smaller community where they could work and raise their children.In 2002, a local government official, the mayor of Lewiston, sent the Somali community a letter. He asked them to stop inviting more family to live in Lewiston. He told the group that the town of Lewiston could not deal with any more Somalis. He said that many new immigrants cost a lot of money. Somali community members were shocked at the mayor\u2019s letter. Some of them insulted the mayor. Some Somalis wrote back that they were helping the community, not hurting it.A hate group also read the mayor\u2019s letter. They saw a chance to spread their message. They planned a hate rally in January 2003. They hoped that people would join their rally against the Somalis.People in the community reacted to the plan for the hate rally. They planned an alternative event. The group planning the new event called themselves the \u201cMany and One Coalition\u201d. They invited local churches, students, and many concerned people to join the event. They used the event to teach people about diversity, or differences in people.They hoped their event would send a message against hate. They believed that their message against hate would be stronger than the hate group\u2019s message.They were right! More than 4,000 people attended the Many and One Coalition\u2019s diversity event. And fewer than 100 people attended the hate rally.Love is stronger than hate. When people act in love, they can make a community stronger. They can stop hate \u2013 together.This is the sixth program in a series of . This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In April of 2021, Jenna Dupuy was hanging out in a local park. This park is in California in the United States. Dupuy was enjoying the park with her friends. But a man walked over to her. He asked where she was from. Dupuy grew up in the United States. But her ancestors were from Korea. She told the man she was Korean. Then he began making bad comments to her. After a short time, he began attacking her. She told the Triton Times:\u201cHe made comments to me and many other people and no one stopped him. He threatened me with physical violence. No one stopped him. I protected myself and he still was able to attack me. People only helped me after I got hurt.\u201dThe man broke Dupuy\u2019s shoulder and gave her a concussion \u2014 a serious injury to her head. Leticia Clark is the Mayor of Tustin, where this incident happened. She said in a statement:\u201cI want to send a clear message. Tustin has zero tolerance for bigotry or racism. I am very disturbed by the rise in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans. As a community, we cannot be silent about these crimes. If we witness acts of hate and discrimination, we must speak out, stand up and stop it.\u201dToday\u2019s Spotlight program is the fourth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs, we are looking at ten ways to fight hate.Hate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center has made this list of ten ways to fight hate. On today\u2019s Spotlight we look at the fourth way to fight hate in your community: Speak Up.The fast rise in anti-Asian hate began in 2020. In March of 2020, the President of the United States made a tweet. In that tweet, he called covid-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d. He continued to call this virus by this name instead of covid-19.Hateful words from leaders have real consequences. Studies have shown that words like this caused the rise in anti-Asian hate and attacks on Asian people in the US. The group Stop AAPI Hate records hate incidents against Asian Americans. In 2020, there were more than 3,700 attacks on Asian people. But in March 2021, that number had increased to over 6,600.But people like Jenna Dupuy are bravely speaking up. In May of 2021, Dupuy was a speaker at a Youth Against Hate rally. At this rally, youth from different groups gathered together to speak out against hate.Several youth organizations planned the rally. The SPLC believes that anyone can fight hate by speaking up like these students did. People can make posts on social media. They can make pamphlets or fliers. They can email local news stations. You can spread tolerance by speaking up. Tolerance means accepting people no matter who they are or what they believe. It means respecting every person equally.It is easy to stay quiet in a difficult situation. No one wants to be a target of violence or hate. And it is difficult to speak up when it seems everyone else has a different opinion. But there are many different ways to speak up.The website learningforjustice.org has produced a guide for teachers who want to stop hate. But these are good tips for any person. They say one way to speak up is to prepare yourself and practice. Remind yourself that you are a person who speaks up against hate. Believe it. This simple exercise can change your mind from doing nothing to taking action.The next step is to memorize some simple phrases. These phrases will work for different situations. For example, when you hear a hateful joke, you can say something like \u201cI do not find that funny\u201d, or \u201cthat offends me\u201d, or \u201cI am surprised to hear you say that\u201d. These phrases can help begin a conversation about stopping hate.You can also interrupt hate by asking questions. Some simple questions are: \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d \u201cWhy would you say something like that?\u201d \u201cWhat point are you trying to make by saying that?\u201d Questions make the person who said the hateful thing have to think about their answer. They may not understand that the thing they said was racist. They may not even be able to explain why they said it. Speaking up can help people examine their part in stopping hate.You can also speak up by learning. Information can encourage tolerance. You can research facts about the effects of hate on a community. We will talk about how to educate yourself in the next program.You can spread this or any information about tolerance at your school, the place where you worship, or on a website. You can bring information to the people who live near you. Offer to talk with them about tolerance and hate.Anyone of any age can fight hate.  is a youth organization. They want to encourage young people to become activists. They want young people to learn about and speak up against tough issues. Jayden Chow is in high school. He is an outreach leader for 626 Speak Out. He told his high school newspaper:\u201cYou have a voice for a reason. And if you have that voice, you should be able to use it for good. And especially in our modern day, you should use your voice to help others. It is especially important to educate yourself. That is not only for school, but socially as well. You need to be aware of what is happening to other people, not only those around you maybe, but everywhere in the world.\u201dSpeak up. Help your community to see hate for what it really is. (Speak up.) Encourage your local radio and television news stations to report hate incidents and peace rallies correctly and fairly. (Speak up.) Write to your local newspapers and magazines. Encourage them to look closely at efforts to fight hate. (Speak up.) You have the power to change your community. Speak up!This is the fourth program in a series of .

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Paris, France. In April 2017, a man invaded the home of Sarah Halimi. He called her hateful names and attacked her. He threw her from a window. She died after this attack. The man wanted to hurt Halimi because she was Jewish.In January 2018, an eight-year-old boy was attacked while walking to tutoring. He was wearing a kind of Jewish hat.In recent years, many Jews like Sarah Halimi and this eight-year-old boy in France have been hurt because of who they are. French government officials say that anti-Jewish beliefs are \u201cspreading like poison\u201d there. More and more Jewish people in France are reporting experiencing crime or hateful speech because of who they are.Crimes done against people because of who they are, are hate crimes. President Emmanuel Macron of France responded to these and other hate crimes. He said:\u201cEvery time a citizen is attacked because of their age, their appearance, or their religion, it is an attack on the whole country.\u201dWhy do hate crimes like these happen? How can France, and other countries, deal with them? Today\u2019s Spotlight program is the fifth in a series of ten programs. In this series of programs we will look at ten ways to fight hate.Hate is powerful enough to destroy people and communities. So the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, has made this list of  in your community. On today\u2019s Spotlight program we will look at the fifth way to fight hate in your community: Educate Yourself.How can a community understand people who do hate crimes? How can they react to such violence and hate? The SPLC says that researching the facts about hate groups and hate crimes can be one answer. They call this educating yourself. When people have the facts about a hate group, they can fight hate. Communities must know about hate groups and hate crime before they can react to them and stop them. But knowledge can also help people stop hating. Hate usually comes from fear. And understanding can defeat fear.A hate crime often starts with a bias. A bias is an opinion about someone who is different from you. A person often makes a bias because he does not understand people from another group. Often, we do not know people who belong to different religious or racial groups than ourselves. If we have never met someone from that group, we can easily form wrong opinions about them. These biases might be negative. Sometimes they encourage prejudices and hate.Every person has biases. Often, people do not even know their own biases. But they express biases in many forms. A person can express his bias in words or actions. The SPLC calls some incidents \u201cbias incidents.\u201d For example, a racial joke is a bias incident. Bias incidents do not involve criminal acts like beatings, starting fires, or damaging property.Hate groups try to use and encourage the biases people already feel. In fact, hate groups are usually very skilled at spreading their biases. They use propaganda. Propaganda is bias information that people use to spread a particular message. These hateful messages can appear as a painting on the side of a building, on a paper hanging in a local store, or even sometimes on television or the radio.Hate propaganda influences how people think of each other. It tries to represent groups of people as less than human. Slowly, members of a community begin to think that a particular group of people is not important or is harmful. Angry, scared individuals may attack the minority group. These criminals believe that their actions are accepted. They may even believe that they are doing good work.The SPLC says that most hate crimes are not committed by hate groups. They are committed by individuals, alone or in small groups. These individuals have listened to hate propaganda. They let their biases influence bad actions. These criminal actions are hate crimes.Any criminal act done against someone because of a bias is a hate crime. Attacking someone because of their religion, race, sexual history, sex, or disability is wrong. It is a hate crime. Many areas punish hate crimes severely. But how do we stop hate crimes from happening?First, it is important to try and understand your own biases. What do you know about people who are different to you? The first step is to learn about people who are different to you. Try to understand them. Learn about them. When we understand and listen to each other, we learn to accept our differences. Continue investigating your own biases.Second, if you observe or experience a hate crime, try to find out if a hate group was involved. You can also research facts about the particular hate group you are trying to stop. What does the group want? What signs or symbols represent the group?Experts say that members of hate groups often want to divide communities. They want to separate a community into racial, ethnic or religious groups. They may want to give particular groups in the community limited rights. Many do not respect or recognize the authority of the government. And they try to harm people who oppose them and their ideas.When you know about the hate groups in your area, you are more prepared to fight against the hate they represent. If you have children, talk to them about how they should react to hate. Share information you have learned with your community.Information and education are powerful. When people have the facts, they can make better decisions. When people  about other cultures, they do not feel threatened by them. Education helps people to understand the world and other people better.Hate and hate crimes cannot continue. Whole communities must join the fight against hate. We can all encourage tolerance and acceptance in our communities.This is the fifth program in a series of . This list is from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.What do you think of when you hear the word \u201cluxury\u201d? Some people may think of lying in the sand on a beautiful ocean beach. Others may think of sitting on a costly boat in the sun, enjoying a cold drink. These are experiences of luxury. But luxury also involves goods and services. Here are some real luxury goods that people can buy:A solid gold baby bed for 16 million dollarsWomen\u2019s underwear, covered in jewels, for 10 million dollarsA brand-name watch for 42000 dollarsA popular hand bag for 4,900 dollarsA martini drink for 1,000 dollarsA one-person dinner for 270 dollarsThese are extreme examples of available luxury goods. Most people could never buy these expensive things. But many people can, and do. What makes people want luxury? Is it good for us? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on luxury.To some people, luxury means excess, or having more than what is necessary. To others, luxury means goods and services that cost a lot of money. In this case, luxury can represent high quality. Or it can also just represent the image of a particular brand name. The Oxford Dictionary defines luxury as both a state of being and as a thing. It says that Luxury is a state of living with ease and excess. And it says Luxury is a thing that is not needed, but desired, expensive, and difficult to get.The global market for luxury goods and services is growing. Euromonitor reports that in five years, from 2010 to 2014, the luxury goods market grew 36%! It estimates that by 2019, the global market for luxury goods will have increased 88% in ten years.So why are luxury goods so popular, especially since they are difficult to get? One of the reasons is\u00a0\u00a0they are so difficult to get. It makes people feel like they have status, or a high position, that other people do not have. The website Psychology Today states,\u201cBuyers purchase luxury goods for different reasons. One reason is that luxury goods give a sense of status and wealth. They help people feel exclusive, or more rare and special than others.\u201dLuxury brand names want to stay exclusive, or only available to a few people. They encourage the sense that people who buy their products are better than others. If too many people have a particular product, it loses its appeal. Simon Peck is from the House of Luxury, a company that sells watches and jewels. Peck told the BBC,\u201cWhen the person who drives you around owns the same watch as you, it is time to look for something better.\u201dBut not everyone wants luxury just to feel better than everyone else. Some people simply want to be\u00a0\u00a0everyone else. Farnoosh Brock writes a blog on the internet. She wrote about her desire for luxury products. Brock travelled several times to Japan. There, she saw many women with expensive, $5,000 bags. Then, she wanted one. She wrote about it on her blog ProlificLiving. She said that buying particular brands is very popular in Japan.\u201cThe brand buying popularity in Japan is about a person\u2019s place in society. The top Western brand names speak loudly in that culture. So naturally, everyone buys them. Possibly this is because everyone wants to belong \u2013 to be accepted as an equal.\u201dBut Brock is also conflicted about the strength of her desire for a luxury bag. She writes,\u201cI really, badly want a luxury Prada bag. Suppose I buy my Prada bag. Will I stop wanting the beautiful sun glasses that go with it? What about the perfect little black dress? Or will I need to learn to redefine the meaning of being pleased and satisfied?\u201dFor other people, luxury is more about beauty. Writer Dana Thomas wrote a book about luxury. Thomas says that not all luxury is greed. She told the Luxury Society,\u201cLuxury is moral when it comes from creativity and not greed. When you create to make something beautiful, then you are being moral, spiritual, and true.\u201dLuxury does not have to only represent a fashionable brand. It can also represent high achievement in beauty and creativity. But you still need to have wealth in order to possess luxury.Buying and experiencing luxury puts a person in a rare group. Many, many people in this world are poor. The World Bank reports that more than 2 billion people live in poverty, and more than 1 billion live in extreme poverty. The United Nations reports that almost half of the world\u2019s children live in extreme poverty. Three hundred million children actually go to bed hungry every night.The inequality of people living in poverty and in luxury is very clear. And it brings up an important question: is luxury morally WRONG? Is it wrong to spend 16 million dollars on a golden bed for a baby? Is it wrong to spend thousands of dollars on shoes? That money could buy food for very poor people. It could support schools. It could do many other things tooThis is a complex debate. You may not be able to buy $5,000 shoes. But you may be able to spend $50, or $100, or possibly even $500. These are still large amounts of money! Any of those amounts could help a poor person. But you need shoes too! How can you tell what exact amount is morally right to spend?Christian teaching moves the question away from numbers and products. The Christian Bible does not say that having wealth is wrong. Or even that desire for beauty and comfort is wrong. It says,\u201cKeep your lives free from the love of money. Be happy with what you have. For Jesus said, \u2018I will never leave you.\u2019\u201dThis teaching asks us to examine our hearts. Jesus\u2019 followers believe that they do not have to\u00a0\u00a0wealth. They can\u00a0\u00a0money, but they should not\u00a0\u00a0money. They believe that God will provide for their needs, including the presence of Jesus.The writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.Next to a church, blue crosses stand in long lines. These crosses mark the place where dead people are buried. This may seem like a sad place. But in the distance, you can hear someone laughing. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Merry Cemetery in the town of Sapanta, Romania.A cemetery is a place for dead people. They are buried there when they die. Many European cultures see death as something that is sad and serious. In most places, cemeteries are very serious.Often, cemeteries are places where people come to remember. They remember friends and family members who are no longer living. A stone marks the place where a person is buried. This stone is a headstone or tombstone. Usually, the headstone is made of a dark rock. The headstone may be flat against the ground or it may stand up.Headstones often have words on them. The words usually tell some information about the person who died. It tells their name. It also tells the dates when the person was born and when the person died. Sometimes, the headstones include a few words about the person\u2019s life, or some religious words.But the cemetery in Sapanta is not a normal cemetery. You will not find gray headstones made of rock here. And many of the people visiting the Merry Cemetery are not sad. Merry is another word for happy. For some people, this cemetery is a place to be merry. It is a place to be happy, to laugh.People are happy at the Merry Cemetery because of the special headstones. The headstones are made of wood. They are in the shape of crosses. The crosses are as tall as a person and painted a special color called \u201cSapanta blue\u201d. The colour blue represents the sky. The Romanian people believe the spirit of a person goes to the sky when he dies. A person carves, or cuts, words and pictures into the wood of the headstone.These carvings show pictures from the life of the person buried there. They paint the carvings with many beautiful colors. Some of the headstones show the person working at their job or doing another thing he enjoyed. Some headstones show how the person died. The words carved into the headstone read as if the person who died is saying them. Here is an example from one headstone. It is about a man who prepared meat for food. The picture shows the man with a large knife in his hand. He is cutting meat. Here is a translation of the headstone:As I lived in this world,I took the skin of many sheepGood meat I preparedSo you can eat freelyI offer you good fat meatand to have a good desire for food.Here are the words from another headstone:Here lies my mother-in-law.If she had lived another year,It would be me lying here.It does not sound like that man liked his wife\u2019s mother very much! Some of the pictures and writing on the headstones are full of humour like this. The headstones make people smile as they walk through the cemetery. But why did the people in Sapanta start making these different headstones?Wood is a very important material to the people in this area of Romania. For thousands of years, people made their homes from wood. They carved pictures and symbols into their homes. Carving wood is an important part of life.Stan Ioan Patras was a wood carver. He is the man who started the Merry Cemetery. Stan\u2019s job was creating carved wood art. In 1934 he started carving wooden headstones. He made them in the shape of a cross. He painted the crosses bright blue. Over the years, more people in the town started using his beautiful crosses as their headstones. He enjoyed learning about the people in his town. When a person died, he would remember what the person was like. He would make a headstone showing part of the person\u2019s life. He made pictures of local culture and wrote about the person\u2019s life. Stan wrote about the bad things and the good things. The headstones showed what the person\u2019s life was truly like.In the 1950s, a group of people from France travelled through Stan\u2019s town. They visited the cemetery with his headstones. The travelers enjoyed the cemetery very much. They gave it the name \u201cMerry Cemetery.\u201d In 1971, an art museum invited Stan to France to present his headstones in a special presentation. After that, many people visited the Merry Cemetery. In fact, his headstones made the Merry Cemetery one of the most visited cemeteries in Europe! The United Nations cultural organization, UNESCO, declared the Merry Cemetery to be a World Heritage Site. Now it is part of the world\u2019s history. It is a protected place.People from all over the world still come to Sapanta to see the Merry Cemetery. But today, a man named Dumitru Pop Tincu carves the headstones. Stan was his teacher. Dumitru spends most of his time putting new paint on the old headstones. There are almost 800 carved headstones in the cemetery, so this job takes a lot of time. Dumitru also leads visitors around the cemetery. He says that people like the cemetery so much, that they want their own headstones to look like the ones there. Dumitru makes headstones for the people of the town. But he also makes almost as many headstones for visitors.Many people think of cemeteries as sad places. But the Merry Cemetery does not make people feel sad. When a person dies, her friends and family do not only mourn her death. They also celebrate her life. The Merry Cemetery uses colourful pictures and poems to celebrate the person\u2019s life. The Merry Cemetery helps all people to remember the joy of life even in the sadness of death.The writer and producer of this program was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from The United States.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Have you ever agreed to meet a friend for a meal? Imagine this. You arrived early and got a good table. You waited. And waited. Now she is almost 30 minutes late. You begin to worry. What if something happened? What if she is hurt and needs help? You send her a message asking if everything is ok. She says that everything is fine. You ask if she is going to be there soon. She messages back, \u201cI forgot!\u201dYou sit there for a minute. You do not feel good about what happened. But what can you say? Anyone can forget a meeting. What really makes you angry is that your friend did not say \u201cI am sorry.\u201d Today\u2019s Spotlight is on when, why, and how people say, \u201cI am sorry.\u201dPeople apologize in many different ways and for different reasons. Some people say \u201csorry\u201d more often than other people. And saying sorry is also cultural. People in some cultures apologize more than people in different cultures. For example, many people believe that people from Canada apologize more often than people from the United States. And people from Britain and Japan apologize a lot each day. In fact, in Japan, there are over 20 different ways to apologize.People say \u201cI am sorry\u201d for many different reasons. Some people will say it if they walk into you on the street.Other people will say it after they say or do something that is not nice.People say sorry if they need your help.Or they may say sorry when something bad happened to another person \u2013 even if they had nothing to do with it.People even say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d about the weather!In many of these cases, saying sorry is easy. But what if you hurt someone you love? Why is it sometimes so difficult to say? Telling someone, \u201cI am sorry\u201d should be easy. It is just words! It does not cost any money. It does not require great skill or education. Then why can it be so difficult to do?People find all sorts of reasons to avoid saying \u201cI am sorry\u201d. They justify what they did. That is, they explain how it was the best thing to do. Sometimes a person who should say sorry only sees what the\u00a0\u00a0person did. They point out what\u00a0\u00a0did wrong. People do this because saying that you are sorry means admitting that you hurt someone else. People do not like to feel guilty.But telling someone \u201cI am sorry\u201d is an important step in fixing relationships. Aaron Lazare is a psychiatrist who studied what an  \u2013 saying sorry \u2013 can do. In an article for Psychology Today he wrote,\u201cI am always amazed by how many of my friends and patients of all kinds hold on to anger for years. It cuts through their own lives and the lives of family and friends. So many of these things could have been avoided or healed with a real apology.\u201dBut what is a real apology? Many experts say there is more to a good apology than just saying the words \u201cI am sorry\u201d. There are several steps. The first step is to admit that you did something wrong. Be clear, not general. Name what you did. For example, do not say, \u201cI am sorry I hurt you.\u201d Instead, say, \u201cI am sorry that I broke your glasses.\u201dYou need to do this to show that you understand how your actions affected the other person. You need to explain that you understand their pain.Next, you need to admit responsibility. You can explain\u00a0\u00a0you did what you did. You can tell the other person that you were not trying to hurt them. But try to imagine what the other person is feeling. And take responsibility for what you did.Finally, you need to tell the person that you will not do that thing again. Explain how you will change your behavior. This can help them rebuild the trust in your relationship. But make sure you honor your promise to change. You need to\u00a0, \u201cI am sorry\u201d But you need to\u00a0\u00a0it as well.Also remember that sometimes, one apology is not enough. Sometimes, when a person is hurt very badly, or has lost their trust in you, it may take a long time for them to accept your apology and forgive you.Here is an example of what an apology like this could sound like. Imagine the situation from the beginning of this program. You are meeting a friend, and she forgot your meeting. Your friend could apologize like this:\u201cI am sorry that I did not meet you at the restaurant. It was not kind of me to leave you waiting. Next time I will make sure to set a reminder on my mobile phone so that I do not forget. I hope you will forgive me.\u201dMany people think that saying \u201cI am sorry\u201d is a sign of weakness. But Aaron Lazare disagrees. He writes,\u201cAn apology is a show of strength. It is an act of honesty because we admit we did wrong. It is an act of generosity because we are giving worth to the people we hurt. It offers hope for a new relationship, possibly even a stronger one. The apology communicates that we are serious about the relationship. Saying \u201cI am sorry\u201d is an act of courage because it opens us up to shame and the risk of feeling stupid, being rejected, and experiencing new pain from the person we hurt.\u201dSaying I\u2019m sorry is often difficult. But it is worth the pain for a better relationship. What about you? Have you ever had to say \u201cI am sorry\u201d? Was it easy or difficult? What would have happened if you did not say it?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A woman walks to the beach on Jeju Island, South Korea. She is going to work. The woman wears a black wetsuit that covers her whole body. She has a mask on her face to keep water out of her eyes. She  deep down into the water. She does not have an oxygen tank. She holds her breath. The woman gathers shellfish from the bottom of the ocean. Then she swims back to the surface with her catch. She will do this up to 100 times this day. And she is 70 years old! This woman is part of the haenyeo. In Korean this means sea women. There are thousands of haenyeo on Jeju Island. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on these strong women of the sea.Jeju Island is mostly made of black volcanic rock. Before modern farming equipment, people could not grow much food here. So, they dove into the sea for food. Many creatures live in shells deep in the ocean. The people of Jeju ate and sold this shellfish to support their families. But by the 1600\u2019s many men from Jeju left the island. They went to fight or to work on ships. The work of diving for shellfish became a job for women \u2013 the haenyeo.The money earned from the haenyeo\u2019s shellfish trade is a large part of Jeju\u2019s economy. But being a haenyeo is also a way of life. They have a deep respect for the ocean. They also have a close connection to each other. And the haenyeo hold a special place in Korean society. Here, it is not common for women to do physical work as the main support for their families.A haenyeo\u2019s work is very physically and mentally challenging. The sea is very cold. It moves with currents and waves. In the past, women dove in light cotton clothing. Today, the haenyeo have diving masks and wetsuits. But these smell very strongly. And the women are often sick from the sea. Working in the ocean is also very dangerous. They dive up to six hours a day. The haenyeo must hold their breath for up to two minutes at a time. Diving can cause injury and even death. The New York Times reports that in the last ten years more than 40 haenyeo have died.This danger is one reason why the number of haenyeo is decreasing. Many modern Korean girls do not want to do such dangerous, physical work. The New York Times reports that in the 1960\u2019s, there were 26,000 haenyeo. There are now only about 4,500. And the working haenyeo are growing old. Eighty-four percent of them are over the age of 60.But people are interested in haenyeo culture, both in South Korea and around the world. Brenda Paik Sunoo lives on Jeju Island. She wrote a book called She explains to the travel website Roads and Kingdoms:\u201cOver the past 15 years or so, the respect for the haenyeo has risen. The haenyeo\u2019s gift is not just economic. It is social. It is cultural.\u201dThe haenyeo are an important symbol of traditional culture. They show the values of hard work, independence and community. Some people may look down on the haenyeo because they do physical labour. Other people respect their hard work and position in society. The haenyeo are a special combination of strength and gentleness.And there are some good things about being a haenyeo. They have a way to make money that gives them financial independence. Haenyeo are also part of an important social community. Ji-ae Chae is a young single mother. She used to work in the capital city, Seoul. But she returned to Jeju to work as a haenyeo. She says that the best part of the work is the support from the other women. Chae tells Roads and Kingdoms:\u201cThey take care of my children. It is very good. My children have grandmothers all around them. The women divers are a big community. When I was in Seoul, I did not like people. When I became a woman diver, I liked people again.\u201dChae is one of the few younger haenyeo. But it is possible that in the future there will be no haenyeo left. It takes a long time to train new divers. And not enough women are making the same choice that Chae has. Yang Hi-bum is a government official on Jeju. He told the New York Times:\u201cMost of the haenyeo will be gone in 20 years unless more women join them.\u201dThe government on Jeju Island is working to save the tradition of the haenyeo. They opened a Haenyeo Museum in 2006. And since 2015, the Jeju government helps the haenyeo pay for equipment and accident and medical insurance. Globally, people also respect and support the haenyeo. In 2016, the divers gained the title of UNESCO Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This recognizes the special spirit of the haenyeo. It also awards their good methods. They are always careful of the environment. Sometimes they do not dive for shellfish, even if they could make a lot of money. This way they protect the natural balance of the ocean. Brenda Sunoo talks about how this also protects the haenyeo:\u201cThey have to use faith to know when to stop. To have enough breath to come up slowly. To not take too much time to take that final sea urchin or abalone that is trapped under the rock.\u201dThe haenyeo show the world courage and patience. They also show the importance of balance. They must balance their lives above and below water. They must balance the money they get with environmental health. This wisdom and practice of balance keeps the women of the seas alive. The future will show whether their tradition stays alive as well.Have you ever heard of these women?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is early October in Munich, Germany. The air is cool and fresh. The leaves on the trees are starting to change their colors. Bright orange and dark red trees fill the hills around the city.Millions of people are gathered in an open area. The open area is in the center of the city. There are musical performances. The people talk and laugh together. The children enjoy mechanical carnival rides. People wear traditional clothes. They sing and dance. Most importantly, they drink beer together. These people are enjoying Oktoberfest.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the traditional Bavarian celebration of Oktoberfest.Oktoberfest is a traditional festival in Munich Germany. Munich is in the south of Germany in the area of Bavaria. This area is famous for its good-tasting beer. People enjoy this alcoholic drink around the world. Beer is made from simple elements: water, grain, yeast and hops. Yeast causes the mixture to change into alcohol. And hops give beer its particular taste.Bavarian beer is famous because of its history. There is evidence to show that this is the oldest beer-producing area in Europe. And many of the beer factories, or breweries, have a very long tradition of making beer. There are 640 breweries in this region!Oktoberfest celebrates this tradition. It also celebrates the traditional culture of Bavaria. The festival begins at the end of September. It starts with a traditional ceremony. The leader of the city of Munich, the mayor, stands in one of the buildings. He holds a metal tube. And he stands in front of a large rounded wooden keg. This container holds the beer. The mayor hits the metal tube, to force it into the keg. The beer flows through the metal tube, and out of the keg. The mayor then shouts in German \u201cIt is tapped!\u201d This act officially opens the festival. Oktoberfest continues for 17 or 18 days.At Oktoberfest, the festival only serves beer made in Munich. Taking part in Oktoberfest is a special honor for the breweries. The beers made for the festival also must have 2% more alcohol than normal beers. They are known as official Oktoberfest Beers.The people of Munich have celebrated Oktoberfest for more than 200 years. So how did this festival begin? It began with a marriage! In 1810 Prince Ludwig married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Their marriage was very important to the citizens of Munich. They had a parade through the city to celebrate. They played music and danced in the streets. Then the people celebrated and drank beer late into the night. The people of Munich enjoyed this event very much. So the city decided that the festival should happen every year.Each year, the city has added more events. They added a show for farm products. People brought their best crops and animals to the festival. Judges gave prizes for the biggest and best products.Then the city added horse races to the festival. People gambled money on the horses. People tried to guess which horse would win the race. If their horse won the race, the person won money. Then he could use this money to buy beer! These events became traditions at the festival. They happened every year.Another important tradition of Oktoberfest is the traditional clothing from Bavaria. Both men and women may wear a Sennerhut. A sennerhut is a traditional hat. It is made with the wool from sheep. It often has a rope around the base. It has symbols from the person\u2019s city or region. Many have flowers embroidered on them with bright cloth thread. Some people also put a small amount of goat hair on their hat. They place it under the rope. This goat hair is said to be good luck.Men wear traditional \u201clederhosen.\u201d Lederhosen are made from animal skin \u2013 leather. They are short trousers for men and boys. They connect to suspenders \u2013 thin pieces of leather worn over the shoulders. Across the man\u2019s chest is also a piece of leather. The leather connects the suspenders. This leather piece has images of flowers and animals.Women wear traditional \u201cdirndls.\u201d Dirndls are special dresses. The dress has four parts. First, there is a white or light-colored shirt. On top of the shirt, a woman wears a bodice. This piece of colored cloth fits tightly to the woman\u2019s chest. Traditional dirndls have a knee-length dress. The woman then ties an apron around her waist on top of the dress. It is meant to keep the clothes under it clean.Traditional lederhosen and dirndls had special meaning. Each region had special cloth they used to make the clothing. Each city and area used special designs and colors. It was always clear what place the person was from.Some of the traditional Oktoberfest activities still happen today. Many people still wear the traditional clothes. And every three years, there is still a show of farm products. But there are no longer horse races. Entertainment is also different today. Loud, modern musical groups play rock music into the night. A modern, mechanical carnival replaced traditional games. Now large rides and games light up the night sky.Since the 1960s, Oktoberfest has become very popular internationally. It started as a small celebration. The only people who participated lived in Munich. Now, Oktoberfest is the largest traditional festival in the world. People from all over the world travel to Munich to enjoy the festival. In 2010 there were over 6 million people at Oktoberfest! They drank over 7 million litres of beer!In 200 years, authorities have only cancelled Oktoberfest a total of 24 times. This has usually been because of war and disease. Most recently, authorities cancelled the festival during World Wars I and II.The tradition of Oktoberfest is still strong in Munich. It still celebrates the traditions and culture of Bavaria. And it will likely continue for many years in the future. Have you ever celebrated Oktoberfest? What traditional festivals do you celebrate where you live?

I\u2019m Anne Muir.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cIn August 1998, a silicon chip was put in my arm. This allowed a computer to watch me. My implant used radio waves to communicate with a network of antennas throughout the department. They sent the signals to a computer. It was programmed to respond to my actions. At the main entrance, a voice box said \u201cHello\u201d when I entered. The computer sensed my movement through the building. It opened the door to my lab for me as I came near to it. It turned on the lights. For the nine days the implant was in place, I performed acts that seemed like magic simply by walking in a particular direction.\u201dKevin Warwick wrote about this experiment with becoming part machine in WIRED magazine. He is a professor of Cybernetics at the University of Reading in England. The study of Cybernetics looks at controlling systems using technology. Warwick had a silicon chip called an implant.There are many people interested in trying this kind of experiment called body hacking. These people want to change their bodies with technology. But there are many questions about it. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on body hacking.Humans have been making changes to their bodies for many years. Some people have mechanical implants for medical or health reasons. This technology can help their hearts work regularly, or help them to hear. Some people have replaced a missing body part, such as an arm or leg, with a mechanical one. As technology gets better, people can do more. But some people want to go even farther. Professor Kevin Warwick says:\u201cSince I was a child I have been interested in the study of robots and cyborgs. Now I am in a position where I can actually become one. I believe this desire \u2013 this wish to explore \u2013 is part of being human.\u201dKevin Warwick became a cyborg when he had a computer implanted, or put into, his arm. A cyborg is a cybernetic organism. It is a being that is part human and part machine. This sounds like something from a story. But it is a part of life for a small group of people.Amal Graafstra helps people add technology to their bodies. Graafstra mainly works with small chips or tags that contain electronically stored information. These are called RFID chips. They are as small as a grain of rice. People use them in many ways. They can be used to open doors or help find things that are lost, and many other ways. Graafstra has implanted RFID chips in himself and in many other people.People changing their bodies with technology call themselves \u201cbody hackers.\u201d Hacking is a way of breaking into something. Body hackers are exploring the relationship between the natural human body and technology. They try to make their bodies do things beyond what humans can usually do. Graafstra told the news organization NPR:\u201cBody hackers view the world differently. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what is broken. A patient may someday very soon come and say, \u2018My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom.\u201dBody hacking takes all kinds of forms. People have put magnets underneath their skin. One man made his finger into a device that connects to computers. This drive stores information. Yet another man attached devices into his head to let him listen to music. Australian artist Professor Stelarc even attached an extra ear \u2013 to his arm. These are only a few of the ways that humans have tried to use technology to become \u201cmore\u201d than human.Neil Harbission from Spain was born with a problem with his eyes. He cannot see any colour except grey. So he had an implant made that \u201cplays\u201d colour for him. He has a camera attached to the back of his head. From this, a long curved antenna hangs in front of his face. It makes sound to let him know what colour things are as he sees them. The antenna works so well that Harbission can even see colours that other humans cannot. It is also connected to the internet. Harbisson no longer considers himself human at all. He calls himself a cyborg.Harbission created the Cyborg Foundation. This organization educates people about cyborgs. Not everyone is happy about the cyborg movement. There are many difficult ideas to think about. Some people say that it is too dangerous. This is especially true when people implant machines into themselves without a doctor\u2019s help.There is a lot that is unknown about body hacking. No one can know what the result of some implants will be. Many people think that the mix of the human body and technology is too risky. Some body hackers have experienced extreme feelings of unexplained fear after getting their implants.And some people simply believe that the human body should remain as it is. They think it is wrong to change the body from its natural state.Richard Wordsworth is an expert in bioethics and bioterrorism. He says that technology is already very easy for people to use. He wonders why people would need to put machines INTO their bodies. He also asks about what happens when that technology becomes old. If a device is under a person\u2019s skin, they will need to have surgery to upgrade it.But Wordsworth also has other concerns \u2013 about safety. Could technology in our bodies actually make us more open to danger? What happens if someone hacks into a person? They could have a lot of power over a body. Wordsworth tells vice.com:\u201cI already give huge amounts of personal data over to my network provider. But with my phone I can unplug if I want to. I can turn off my handset and put it in a drawer. I could not do this as easily if the technology was buried somewhere in my arm.\u201dThere are still only a few people who practice body hacking. Will body hacking become a larger movement? And is it worth the danger? For Kevin Warwick, the answer is easy. He tells WIRED:\u201cMy entire team is working with me to bring humans and technology together in a way that has never been attempted. The excitement of looking into a new world \u2013 the world of cyborgs \u2013 is worth the risks.The writer of this programme was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Every October 31st children all across the United States do something strange. They imagine they are someone or something else. They put on strange clothes. They may even paint their faces or wear false hair. They walk around from house to house. They knock on the door of the house. When someone opens the door all the children say the same thing:The person in the house gives them a sweet candy treat! The children do this again and again for one house to the next. This is the holiday of Halloween. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Halloween \u2013 and other holidays like it.The tradition of Halloween is very old. In fact, people who study history believe that Halloween traditions began as long as 2,500 years ago. They believe these traditions started in ancient Ireland, with the Celtic people.The Celts of Ireland counted two parts of the year. The bright half of the year was summer. And the dark half was winter. They believed that the bright half of the year ended around October 31. After this day, winter was coming. The Celtic people called this change in season Samhain, which means the \u2018end of summer.\u2019Samhain was a special time. It was both a celebration of the end of summer, or life, and the beginning of winter, or death. So it was also a frightening time. The Celts believed that there was a natural barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead. But, at Samhain, the barrier disappeared. They believed that spirits could rise from the dead and come among the living.Historians say that during the celebration of Samhain the Celts dressed themselves in different clothes. They walked through their villages making lots of noise. And they caused disorder in the village. They believed that this frightened the spirits away. Some historians also believe that the Celts sacrificed humans or animals during this celebration as a warning to the spirits.Other people groups in other parts of the world also celebrated similar holidays. Around the year 400, Christians came to Ireland. They began to celebrate Christian holidays at the same time the Celts celebrated their holidays.For many years the Christians had a celebration in honour of saints \u2013 special people in the Church. They called this celebration \u2018All Saints Day,\u2019 or \u2018All Hallows Day.\u2019 It was a day to celebrate these special saints, or \u2018holy,\u2019 people. They celebrated \u2018All Hallows Day\u2019 on November 1st.The night before a special day is called an \u201ceve\u201d. After a time, people began calling the Samhain celebration \u2018All Hallows Eve.\u2019 Since language is always changing, people soon shortened the name. Instead of \u2018All Hallows Eve\u2019, they called it \u2018Halloween\u2019, and that is what we call it today!In the 16th century, another tradition began. In the days leading up to the Samhain celebration, the people of Ireland and Britain dressed in different clothes. They went house to house. At each house, they sang songs to the dead. Then the people of the house gave them small sweet cakes.Irish settlers brought Halloween traditions to the United States in the middle 1800\u2019s. But people there did not really celebrate Halloween until almost 100 years later \u2013 during the early 1900\u2019s. For most children today in the US, Canada, the UK and other places, Halloween is about candy and fun clothes. But other people have a day like this to celebrate the people who have lived and died before us.Many countries have a celebration to remember people who have died. Some celebrations are at different times of the year. They do not always call these celebrations \u2018Halloween\u2019. But the celebrations have similar meanings. So, how do you celebrate Halloween?On Halloween in Belgium, there are parades and scary  like spiders and ghosts. But people also light candles. These candles help people remember their dead relatives.In the Czech Republic they celebrate Dusicky. People visit the place where a family member is buried.In China, people do not celebrate Halloween. But they have a very similar celebration called \u2018Yue Lan\u2019. It is the \u2018Festival of the Hungry Ghosts.\u2019 The people there believe that spirits visit the world for 24 hours. Some people burn pictures of fruit or money. They believe that the spirits can see these burned pictures. And the burned pictures bring calm and peace to the ghosts. This celebration is not a time for games or dressing up. Instead, it is a day to remember and respect the memory of dead ancestors.In Mexico, the people celebrate \u2018Dia De Muertos\u2019 \u2013 \u2018the day of the dead.\u2019 Some other Latin American countries also celebrate this holiday. It is not a scary day. It is a time to remember friends and family members who have died. A three-day celebration begins on October 31. During this time, families make special places in their homes to honour their dead friends and family. They place candy, photographs, fresh water, flowers, and food and drink in this special place. They burn candles and strong smelling incense to help spirits find their way home. The last day of the celebration is called \u2018All Soul\u2019s Day\u2019. On this day, living family members eat a meal at the gravesite where dead friends and family are buried. They tell stories and remember good times of when the person was alive.And the tradition of Halloween is still popular in Ireland too! Today, on Halloween, Irish boys and girls dress like ghosts, witches, or other frightening creatures. They light big fires. Many children go around to different houses.

I\u2019m Luke Haley.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Say Cheese! Smile!In many places, people smile when they have their picture taken. They are smiling purposefully, to look happy. A smile is a worldwide expression. It is a way that all . All humans know how to smile. But why do we smile? Are there different kinds of smiles? And can a smile mean something different for a man than for a woman? Does a person\u2019s culture affect how much they smile? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on smiling.The corners of your mouth lift up. Your lips curve around your teeth. Your cheeks move closer to your eyes. You are smiling! And you are not the only one. Humans smile a lot. In fact, smiling is instinctual. This means that people often smile without even thinking about it. Even babies smile. People were created to be able to smile!People smile in many different situations. Many people smile when they are happy! But people also smile when they are afraid, or uncomfortable. And people smile for many different reasons. The first is that it is a natural instinct. Imagine that you see an old friend come through your door. You will most likely smile with joy. But you have not told yourself to smile. Your face just does it! It is a natural reaction to your feeling of happiness.Scientists think there is another reason people smile. We often smile when we meet people we do not know. This shows that we are friendly. Smiling helps us protect ourselves. We decide who we can trust by a person\u2019s smile. A smile shows that a person is friendly. He or she is not dangerous. This may be why some people smile when they are uncomfortable or afraid. It is a way to create a connection with other people.Smiling has one other purpose \u2013 it makes people feel happier. Dr. Nakia Gordon is a professor of psychology at Marquette University. She told Marquette Magazine:\u201cYou do not have to be happy to smile. And you can smile and not be happy\u2026 at least not at first. But smiling can make you feel happier. Research suggests that our brains receive feedback from other parts of our bodies to help decide how we feel. Smiles do not just represent and communicate how we feel to others. They also help us experience those feelings more fully.\u201dSmiling, even when you are not happy, can make you feel better. But not all smiles are the same. Different kinds of smiles mean different things. Guillaume Duchenne was a French doctor in the nineteenth century. He studied facial expressions. Duchenne looked at the muscles in the human face. He studied how they moved to make facial expressions. He found that there were two main sets of muscles that people used to smile. One of these is around the mouth, as the lips move up. The other set of muscles is around the eyes. When people smile in a particular way, their eyes close a bit. This smile often creates lines in the skin, wrinkles, around the eyes.It is possible to smile just using the mouth muscles. Scientists have shown that this kind of smile is often not voluntary or from a natural reaction. It is not a real smile, caused by feelings of joy or happiness. It is the kind of smile that people do for a camera, or to be polite. A smile that moves the muscles near the eyes is usually a real smile. Scientists call this a Duchenne smile. And studies show that people can tell the difference. People trust a person who has a Duchenne smile more than someone who just smiles with his or her mouth.But smiling also means different things for different kinds of people. For example, men and women often have different habits of smiling. In many places, women smile more than men. Is this because women are happier? Not really. It is more likely because girls and women are taught to smile more than boys and men. In many cultures, smiling makes a person seem less serious and more friendly. Men may feel pressure to seem more serious. Women often feel pressure to be friendly. Marianne LaFrance is a social psychologist. She wrote a book about smiling. In an interview with American Scientist she said:\u201cSmiling is done mostly for other people. It is usually believed to show a positive emotional state of the smiler. But in fact, smiling is socially useful. We would not survive in our day-to-day contacts with other people if there was not some level of smiling by people. It more often falls to women to take care of that part of things.\u201dSmiling is also different across cultures. In some places, such as the United States, people smile a lot. In other cultures, such as Russia, smiling too much may seem strange. In many countries, smiling can have many different meanings.A team of scientists in Japan and the United States did a study. They tested if people\u2019s smiles were seen as trustworthy. They found that in Japan, people judged trust by the expression around people\u2019s eyes. But in the United States, people looked mainly at the mouth.The scientists think this is because people in the United States usually show more facial expression. So they expect a large smile to show in the mouth. But in Japan, people do not always show their emotion through facial expressions. So to find out what someone really feels, they look more at the eyes. A real smile, or Duchenne smile, will show in a person\u2019s eyes.This difference between Japan and the United States can also be seen in another kind of smiling. In modern times, people communicate more with technology and media. Smiles are a part of this communication too! In SMS and text messages, people use . This helps to communicate emotions quickly and easily. In Japan, a smiling face symbol has a straight mouth and curved eyes. But a Western smiling face has a curved mouth and straight eyes!It does not matter if smiles are texted or seen on a friend\u2019s face. Smiles are an important part of  expression. Smiling can make you start to feel better when you are sad. And smiling at other people can make them feel good too. In the words of Mother Theresa: \u201cWe shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.\u201dThe writer of this program was Rena Dam. The producer was Michio Ozaki.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Robin Basselin. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is an autumn day in Iowa, in the United States. A small crowd of people gather together. They are standing in a huge, flat field. All around, there is green grass and farm land. In the far distance, there is a round target. On the target, there are brightly colored rings or circles.One man stands in front of the crowd. He holds a bow \u2013 a weapon that shoots arrows. He gently places an arrow on the bow. He pulls the arrow back toward his ear. He carefully aims at the target. He releases the bow. The arrow flies through the air. After 210 meters, the arrow hits the target. The crowd cheers. The archer has set a new world record. He has completed the world\u2019s longest archery shot to hit a target.This is an amazing event. But it is even more amazing than you might think. The archer that broke the record is Matt Stutzman. And he has no arms! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Matt Stutzman, the armless archer.Matt Stutzman was born in 1982. When he was born, he did not have arms. He was disabled, but he was healthy in every other way. When Stutzman was 4 months old, his parents decided that they could not care for him.\u00a0 They wanted someone to adopt him. So, they surrendered their parental rights. They hoped that other parents would care for their son \u2013 and make him a part of their family.When Stutzman was 10 months old, Leon and Jean Stutzman did just that. They adopted him. The Stutzmans raised Matt on their family farm.\u00a0They loved and cared for him. They taught him to work hard. And even though he had a disability, they encouraged him to try and do anything he wanted to do. Jean Stutzman wrote about Matt\u2019s story on the website mattstutzman.com. She explained,\u201cOur family plan was to give Matt the freedom to try almost anything \u2013 if he could complete it on his own. The natural reaction would have been to quickly enter each situation and help him.\u201dHowever, the Stutzmans chose not to help Matt right away. They chose to let him try, fail and try again. If Matt could not find a way to do something, they would help him. But they always let him try alone first.This may seem like an unusual way to raise a child with a disability. But Matt Stutzman is thankful for his parents\u2019 teaching. They taught him that if you think something is not possible, then it will not be possible. But if you work hard and believe it is possible, you can achieve great things. Stutzman believes this has helped him succeed at many things in life \u2013 including archery. Today, Stutzman lives a completely un-adapted life. He has not changed anything in his home or car to make it easier for him to live without arms. He also does not use prosthetic arms \u2013 arms created by doctors and scientists. The way the Stutzmans raised Matt has strongly influenced him. On his website, he explains,\u201cI was born without arms. But I was blessed to have two amazing and patient parents that raised me.\u00a0They taught me a long time ago, that impossible is a way of thinking. And they taught me not to think that way. This has served me well.\u201dStutzman was blessed with good parents. But he was also born with very good physical skill. Stutzman quickly learned to do many things with his feet. In fact, he could do many things with his feet better than most people could do these same things with their hands. It was clear at an early age that he had good skill and aim.Stutzman told the Telegraph news organization a funny story about this. When he was young, he used to pull fruit off the trees on his family farm. Often, he would use his feet to kick the fruit at his brother. For most people, kicking a small piece of fruit and aiming it well would be difficult. But Stutzman said he could hit his brother in the head every time! Stutzman recognized at this young age that he had great physical ability. And he learned to use his physical ability to do many things. This helped him as he grew up.When Stutzman was 16 years old, he bought his first bow and arrow. He wanted to hunt animals with it. After buying the bow, Stutzman needed to learn how to shoot it without arms. But there was no one to teach him how to do this. Stutzman joked about this with the NPR news organization. He said,\u201cIf you search the internet using Google and write \u2013 \u2018how to teach a guy without arms to shoot\u2019 \u2013 you will not find that. Usually, you can find anything on Google. But you just cannot find that.\u201dSo Stutzman had to teach himself. He learned to hold the bow with his feet. He also learned to use the side of his mouth to guide the release of the arrow from the bow. It is an unusual method for shooting a bow and arrow. But Stutzman believes that his lack of arms is helpful in archery. He told the MSNBC news organization,\u201cI believe how I shoot is an advantage. I use my leg and my leg is the strongest part of my body.\u201dStutzman\u2019s skill, method and desire to compete have made him very successful. On October 30, 2011, Stutzman set the World Record for the longest archery shot to hit a target. And in September of 2012, he won a silver medal award at the London Paralympic Games. Stutzman hopes this is just the beginning of his success. He told the KCCI news organization,\u201cI want to be the best in world. Not just the best archer with no arms or with a disability. This is what encourages me to keep training and working.\u201dHowever, winning is not Stutzman\u2019s only reason for competing. He also wants to encourage people. Stutzman told Telegraph news,\u201cI hope that I can affect even one person in a positive way. If I can show one person that life is not so bad and that they can achieve anything \u2013 that is very important for me.\u201dThe writer of this program was Robin Basselin.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Do you have anything about your body that you want to change? Maybe you wish you had stronger arms or legs? Do you want to look more like an athlete? Charles Atlas wanted to change his body. He was small and weak. And he did not like it. He worked hard to become a strong man. He then used his success to create a very large exercise company. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Charles Atlas.In 1903, an 11-year-old boy moved to the United States \u2013 to Brooklyn in New York. He was from Italy. His name was Angelo Siciliano. His family did not have a lot of money. Angelo was small, and often sick. The other boys often beat him up.There is a famous story about Angelo. In the story, he was a young man visiting a nearby beach. He was trying to get a girl to like him. A much bigger man kicked sand in his face. Angelo felt shame. He was so small that he could not fight back. He knew he could not win the fight. So he decided to change his body. He decided to get stronger.There were not many exercise programs or classes for him to join. And he did not have enough money to pay for training. So Angelo started exercising by himself, in his own home. He started by lifting things that were heavy and making his own equipment. But this method was not very successful. And he did not have money to buy more equipment.Then one day he visited the zoo. He watched the lion\u2019s strong muscles as it moved. He understood that the lion was getting stronger as it stretched its body. This gave Angelo the idea to change how he was exercising. He would add stretching and call his program Dynamic Tension.Dynamic means movement. And tension happens when two things oppose, or are against, each other. Angelo\u2019s system combined moving and stretching, tightening muscles for tension, and breathing. It did not require any equipment or weights. It used the weight of a person\u2019s body to create strength. Today, this method is commonly called isometrics.Angelo practiced Dynamic Tension for a few months. As a result he was no longer small and weak. He was big and strong. His friends noticed his new body. They told him that he looked like a statue that was on the top of a local hotel. It was a statue of Atlas. Atlas is a god from old Greek stories. The story says that Atlas was so strong that could hold up the whole earth on his shoulders. Angelo liked this name. So he changed his name to Charles Atlas!With his new body, Charles Atlas began posing as a model for many artists making statues. Around this time, he also took part in competitions to find the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Beautiful Man\u201d and the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Perfectly Developed Man\u201d. He won both titles. Soon after this, he decided to make his success into a business. He found a business partner and started to sell his exercise plan. Now other people could become strong and well-developed just like him.Charles Atlas wanted to show people that his method really worked. He often demonstrated his strength. He worked in travelling shows. He lifted heavy weights. He balanced on his hands. The writer Jerry Cowle described meeting Charles Atlas at a summer camp.\u201cFirst he tore a thick paper phone book in half. Next he bent an iron bar into a horseshoe shape with just his hands. Then he put a long iron bar in his teeth and had two men hang from it, one from each end. Finally he lay on a bed of sharp nails while the same two men stood on a piece of wood across his chest. We all cheered. Atlas deserved the title \u2018World\u2019s Most Perfectly Developed Man\u2019.\u201dAtlas made his Dynamic Tension exercises into a 12-week program. He used his own story to sell the program. Young boys read about the program in the back of comic magazines like Superman, Batman, or Spiderman. The comic story advertisement showed a small boy getting sand kicked in his face. Then the boy did Dynamic Tension. He was then able to defend himself.Charles Atlas never stopped building his business. He performed acts of strength often. He also cared about the people who bought his program. Many people liked that Atlas himself would write to people who bought the program. And he never stopped working to improve the program. He continued to make new and better exercises.By the 1950s, Atlas had sold over a million copies of his exercise program. People from all over the world bought it. They wrote to thank him for changing their lives. The program was translated into seven different languages. For the next 20 years it was the most popular exercise program in the world. In fact, people can still buy it today!Atlas also believed his success came because of how he lived his life. He did not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. He encouraged people to go to church. He told people to get up early in the morning. He thought it was important for boys and girls to keep their rooms clean and organized. And even though he was a wealthy man, he lived in a simple home with his family.People still use exercise programs. There are many new kinds to choose from. People still want to change their bodies. Atlas\u2019 Dynamic Tension program is just one of many exercise programs. But Charles Atlas showed the world that you do not need complex equipment to become strong. You do not need to pay someone lots of money to teach you to be healthy. All you need is your own body, hard work, and clean living.What do you think?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Ten men are on the court \u2013 five on each team. They are playing a game with an orange ball. They pass it back and forth. They bounce it on the hard gym floor. They are trying to get the ball through a hoop. The hoop is small and round, and high in the air. So the men must throw the ball with speed and accuracy. The teams try to block each other\u2019s attempts to throw the ball. This is the world\u2019s second most popular team sport \u2013 basketball.Many famous basketball players are from the United States. But not all! Manute Bol played for almost 10 years in the NBA \u2013 the National Basketball Association in the United States. He was not from the US, but from Sudan. For many years, he was the tallest player in the NBA. Many people remember him for playing basketball. Others remember him for how much he loved his home country of Sudan. Today\u2019s Spotlight is about the life of Manute Bol.Manute Bol was born in Sudan in a village of the Dinka people. His name means \u201cspecial blessing.\u201d Before Bol was born, his mother had two babies die. So his parents believed Bol was a special blessing. They hoped he would grow to take care of the family\u2019s cows. But Bol always wanted to do more. He wanted to explore different places.The Dinka are some of the tallest people in Africa. But Bol was tall even for the Dinkas! He was about 2.3 meters tall. When he was young, many people would watch him and laugh at him. Bol\u2019s cousin remembered how difficult it was for Bol to be so tall. He told The Washington Post:\u201cManute did not like people to look at him. When he went to the market, traffic stopped. Many people stopped their cars and got out to laugh at him.\u201dBol\u2019s cousin thought Bol could be a very good basketball player. Another cousin told Bol that he could be rich and famous if he played in the United States. So Bol decided to try playing basketball.Bol started playing for a small team in Khartoum. But he did not know how to play! But he worked hard and learned quickly. Tony Amin, the coach who guided and led the team, remembers teaching Bol how to play. He described one of the things Bol learned how to do:\u201cManute was very, very happy when someone shot the basketball and he blocked it. You do not find tall players like Manute on other teams. We were expecting a player like this would one day achieve something.\u201dIn 1982, a coach from the United States saw Bol playing. He immediately brought Bol to the US to play basketball. Bol was , but he was not very strong. People made fun of him because of his height and body. One coach even said that Bol was so thin that he would break like an insect. Many people wondered why Bol was in the NBA. They thought he was a joke.But those people were wrong. Bol started playing in the NBA in 1985. In his first year, he blocked 397 shots. This was an average of five shots each game. It was also a new record for a player in his first NBA season! He did not score many points. But Bol became famous for blocking shots. Some people even called him a \u201cshot-blocking\u201d machine! Bol played in the NBA for a long time. This is unusual. Many people get injured and leave basketball early. The average player only plays for five years. Yet Bol played in the NBA for almost 10 years! He played for four different teams.Bol lived and worked in the United States. But he loved Sudan. And he never forgot his home country or the people who lived there. Around that time, Sudan was in the middle of war. Bol often travelled back to Sudan to help others. He supported family members who were living in Sudan during the war. Bol explained to Sports Illustrated:\u201cGod guided me to America and gave me a good job. But he also gave me a heart so I would look back.\u201dBol worked for peace in Sudan. He encouraged the opposing sides to come together. He even took part in government peace talks. He spent much of his money helping Sudan.But he also believed that education was very important. He believed that the way to achieve peace in Sudan would come through education. So he helped build a school in his home village of Turalei \u2013 the Manute Bol School. Then he had a bigger dream. Bol told The Telegraph:\u201cMy dream is to build schools across Sudan, because with education, you can have a good life, find a job, and improve\u2026 The children are the future of Sudan, no matter where they come from.\u201dChildren continue to learn at the Manute Bol School that he helped build. Today, it has two buildings and six classrooms. And in February 2017, the students placed first in their county for their annual exams!Bol\u2019s plan was to build 41 schools throughout Sudan. But he was never able to build those schools. He died in 2010 from kidney failure and a rare skin condition. He was only 47 years old. When Bol died, one of his teams released a statement that described how Bol had influenced the world around him. It said:\u201cHe was a great basketball player. But people will remember him for how hard he worked. They will remember him working in his native Sudan and the cities in which he played.\u201d\u00a0What about you?

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Mercy and Agnes are sisters from Kenya. They are part of the Maasai tribe. They told their story to the organization Equality Now. When they were 10 and 11 years old, they were supposed to take part in a ceremony. This  would celebrate moving from being a girl to a woman. Ceremonies like this are often beautiful and exciting. But Mercy and Agnes were afraid. They knew that this ceremony would also involve cutting their sexual organs.Mercy and Agnes did not want to go through the ceremony. They decided to run away. They received help from some adults they knew. These adults guided them to Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative, or TNI. Tasaru means \u201crescue\u201d in the local Maa language. There, they met Agnes Pareyio. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Agnes Pareyio and her work to end female genital mutilation.Women all around the world have experienced female genital mutilation, or FGM. FGM involves cutting a woman\u2019s sexual organs. It can involve a small cut, or completely cutting off a woman\u2019s sexual organs. The World Health Organization estimates that 200 million girls have been cut.There are no medical reasons to cut. And FGM often causes severe pain, extreme bleeding, and infections. Some girls even die. Even if the girl lives, FGM can cause problems with her body and in childbirth.Governments and organizations internationally recognize that FGM is a violation of human rights. However, FGM still happens in many cultures. For many, it is a cultural tradition. People are often strongly attached to these traditions.This is why Agnes Pareyio continues her work. Pareyio comes from the Maasai culture in Kenya. When she was 14, her mother told Agnes she would be cut. Agnes did not want to be cut. Her father supported her. But her village did not support her. They made fun of her and called her names. They said they would never accept her. They said no one would marry her.So, Pareyio agreed and had her sex organs cut. She bled a lot and was in a lot of pain. But she did not cry, because she did not want to look like she was afraid. Maasai women are not supposed to show fear. Instead, she felt something else. Pareyio told One Billion Rising:\u201cAs I lay there after being cut, I made myself a promise. I was going to do everything I could to stop this ever happening to another girl. My daughters would not be cut. And the daughters of the Maasai would not be cut.\u201dThis promise has defined Pareyio\u2019s life. FGM was banned in Kenya in 2011. But it continues there. Pareyio works in Kenya to stop FGM, especially with the Maasai. She founded TNI in 1999. It began as a place where girls who ran away from FGM and early marriages could continue their education. But today, two of TNI\u2019s most important programs deal with protecting girls from FGM.One of TNI\u2019s programs involves different ceremonies for girls to become women. As a member of the Maasai tribe, Pareyio knows how culturally important FGM is for many women. She wants to offer another choice that protects young girls from FGM but still honors Maasai traditions. The traditional ceremony for Maasai girls to become women is four days long. The girls dress in their best clothes and wear their most beautiful jewelry. They sing traditional songs, and tribal leaders bless the girls with milk and water. A leader performs FGM on the girls. And at the end of the ceremony, the community welcomes them as women.The new ceremonies honor the beauty of the tradition while stopping the FGM. All of the elements of the traditional custom are the same except that the girl is not cut. Instead, the girl receives information about the value of education and health.Other organizations also use this method. They keep the good parts of the ceremony. But they replace the cutting with a symbol. Instead of cutting, leaders pour milk on a girl\u2019s legs to represent how she has become a woman. Sarah Tenoi is another Maasai anti-FGM activist in Kenya. She explains the purpose of these new ceremonies to The Guardian:\u201cWe know that if we can change everyone\u2019s mind then we will end FGM. Our message is that we are encouraging people to change one part of Maasai culture, but not give up all of what makes us proud to be Maasai.\u201dTNI\u2019s other main program is to reconnect girls to their families. Most of the girls who run away from FGM do not want to stay away from their families forever. So Pareyio and her co-workers decided to use a traditional Maasai reconciliation process to return the girls to their families and their village.This process involves meeting with parents, family members, and other members of the community. Village leaders and other officials also become involved. Everyone works together and promises not to force the girls to be cut. It is a village-wide promise to protect and support the girls. And it welcomes the girls to come home and become part of the village again.Pareyio explains to The Huffington Post how important it is for entire communities to be involved in these reconciliation ceremonies:\u201cThe ceremonies are a public promise by the girls and their families to keep them away from FGM, early marriage and other dangers that they could face when they are young women, when they are extra vulnerable.\u201dSix years after they ran away from home, Mercy and Agnes returned to their village through one of these reconciliation ceremonies. They saw their family again and were accepted back into their community. They are no longer afraid of FGM.Changing a culture is a long and difficult process. It involves patience, understanding, and working with many different people. But Pareyio continues to work to end FGM in the Maasai culture, one girl at a time.What about you?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is four o\u2019clock in the morning. The city is Washington, DC in the United States. Almost everyone in the city is sleeping. The government buildings along the streets are quiet and empty. Few cars are on the roads. And the city is dark. In a home near the middle of the city, a telephone rings. A woman answers. The woman\u2019s name is Peggeliene Bartels.The man calling Bartels is a family member.\u00a0 He is from her family\u2019s village of Otuam \u2013 in the country of Ghana. He is calling with some strange news. This telephone call will change Bartels\u2019 life forever.The man explains that the village of Otuam needs a new king. And he tells Bartels that local officials have chosen her. Bartels cannot believe it. She is tired. And she thinks it is a joke. But it is not. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on King Peggeliene Bartels, or King Peggy.Peggeliene Bartels was born in 1953, in Takoradi, Ghana. As a young adult, she studied in England. When she finished university, she moved to the United States. Bartels began working at the Embassy of Ghana in Washington DC. There, she is a secretary. She answers telephones. She types documents and e-mails. And she serves Embassy officials and visitors. Bartels enjoys her job. She has worked at the Embassy for more than 30 years. And in 1997, Bartels became a United States citizen.While Bartels lived and worked in Washington, DC, her uncle was king of Otuam.\u00a0 Her mother\u2019s brother ruled the village for many years.\u00a0 But in 2008, the king died. And leaders in the village had to choose a new king. The leaders suggested names of people that might replace the king.\u00a0 One person suggested Bartels.\u00a0 This was an unusual suggestion. Past kings had all been men.The village leaders performed a ritual to choose the new leader. This religious tradition involved pouring liquid on the ground and then saying the name of each possible king.\u00a0 If the liquid quickly evaporated after one of the names, the leaders would choose that person to be king. The  confirmed that Bartels should be king. The village leaders were not sure about choosing a woman to be king. So, they performed the ritual three times to be sure. Finally, the leaders agreed.\u00a0 They would offer the king\u2019s position to Bartels.When Bartels\u2019 family member called, he told her that her uncle had always wanted her to be the next king. Bartels never knew that. And she was not sure if she should accept this new job. She had a job in the United States.\u00a0 And as king she would be responsible for Otuam\u2019s 7000 villagers.\u00a0 Bartels thought about the offer for many days.\u00a0 Soon, she felt like God was telling her to take it. She told the news organization NPR:\u201cWhen they told me, I was a little afraid to accept it. It comes with responsibilities. And I have a job as a secretary in the United States! I have my own responsibilities and bills to pay! And to become king, you have to be really rich. But then, it was like someone was talking to me. A voice said, \u2018Accept it. This is what you are supposed to do. You will have help so you can help your people.\u2019\u201dSo Peggy Bartels accepted the job of king. People usually only use the term \u201cking\u201d for male leaders. \u201cQueen\u201d is the word for female rulers. But Bartels did not want her people to call her \u201cQueen Peggy.\u201d She wanted them to call her \u201cking\u201d. She told the news organization, CNN:\u201cMost of the time, a king is the one who has all the power to do things. The queen has power over children\u2019s issues. And the queen reports to the king.\u201dBartels knew that the term \u201cking\u201d would communicate power. So having this title was important for her. When Bartels told the men she wanted to be called king, they were surprised. She told NPR:\u201cWhen I said this, all the men stood up. They said, \u2018A woman is speaking like this?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, I am serious. Treat me like a man because I am a man\u2026 Do not look at me as a woman. If you understand me as a man, then we can move forward. But if you think I am a woman, we are not going to be able to work together.\u2019\u201dToday, the people of her village respect King Peggy. And she is beginning to change minds. She told NPR:\u201cThey are beginning to accept me for who I am. The women are trying to understand me. They see that as a woman, you can do a lot. You do not have to sit down and wait for a man to succeed in life. If I am a woman and I am doing this, they can also do it.\u201dKing Peggy has worked hard to improve the lives of people in her village. Since becoming king, she has raised money for the village. This money has helped send children to school. It has helped buy computers for the school classrooms. The village now even has an emergency vehicle!King Peggy still lives in the United States. And she still works as a secretary at the Embassy. But she remains connected to her people. She visits Ghana for one month each year. And every day at 1:00 in the morning, she calls her representative in Otuam. This family member tells her everything that is happening in the village.\u00a0 And he tells the villagers what she says.\u00a0 King Peggy hopes to move back to Otuam when she retires from her job at the Embassy.King Peggy did not expect to become King of Otuam. But now, she believes it is her calling. She has faith that God meant for her to be king. And she believes God gives her strength to lead her people. She told CNN:\u201cI recognize that we all have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it. Helping my people has really helped me. I know that I can really touch and change their lives. I would have really regretted not accepting this calling.\u201dThe writer and producer of this program was Dianna Anderson. The voices you heard were from the United States and the United Kingdom.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.We are going to ask a shocking question right now. Would you ever kill someone? Wait, do not say \u201cno\u201d immediately. Think about it. What if someone was threatening your family? What if your country were being attacked? What if you could save millions of lives by taking only one? Would you kill then?Ethics is the debate over how people should act. Sometimes this debate takes place in school \u2013 as a theory. Other times these debates take place in the middle of a person\u2019s life. People need to decide what is best and what to do. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on a real ethics question that one man faced. We tell the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and how he tried to help kill another man.In 1931, Dietrich Bonhoeffer completed his studies to become a church leader in Germany. He taught and wrote books. But Germany was changing all around him. The Nazi political party was rising to power and Adolf Hitler was taking control of the country. To get more control, Hitler only permitted the state-approved church. Other churches were closed. Hitler began to tell people that their first loyalty belonged to the nation of Germany, not to God.Bonhoeffer disagreed with this. He believed this was not good Christian teaching. He became part of a group of 2000 church leaders who formed the Pastors Emergency League. They opposed the state-approved Nazi church. When pressure from the government increased, this group changed. They became the illegal Confessing Church. The Confessing Church believed that Christians should follow God first, not the nation or Hitler. Bonhoeffer served as the head of the Confessing Church\u2019s school.Bonhoeffer was a pacifist. He believed that violence is never the solution to any problem. A pacifist works to make change, but through protest and talking together. But Bonhoeffer began to hear stories of Jewish people being killed and his ideas changed. He decided that pacifism was a good theory, but to not act was to act. If he did not act, he was letting Hitler win. If he did nothing to fight the evil he saw, he was supporting the evil.So Bonhoeffer joined a group working to fight Nazism. He was still permitted to travel outside the country. He took secret information to Great Britain. He tried to gather support for the Confessing Church and tell the world that not every German supported Hitler.Bonhoeffer did have the chance to escape from Germany completely. He could have stayed in a safe place. He was permitted to travel to New York City. But after only a few weeks, he decided to return to Germany. He knew that if he was going to help fix the country he loved, he would have to stay during the struggle for the heart of Germany.So he went home. He could not support Hitler\u2019s government. But he could not do nothing. He believed that killing was wrong, but he also believed it was wrong not to help people in trouble. During this time, he spent a lot of time thinking and writing about the correct thing to do as a Christian. After a time, he decided to join a group planning to kill Adolf Hitler. But the attempt failed. Bonhoeffer was one of the people who was caught. The German government arrested him and put him in prison.In prison, Bonhoeffer wrote many letters and documents. Some of these explained how he decided to join the group trying to kill Hitler. He said that there are two things that should guide Christians through life. The first is the needs of the people around you. In this case, these were the millions of people Hitler was killing.The second thing that should guide Christians is the model of Jesus Christ. Jesus has a group of teachings called \u201cThe Beatitudes\u201d. These teachings concentrate on the poor, those who are sad, and those who suffer. Bonhoeffer believed that Christians should remember these two things when trying to make a difficult choice.Bonhoeffer attempted to follow Jesus. He saw suffering people and acted. He stood up for poor and hurting people. Because he lived this belief, the government sentenced him to death. The prison doctor watched as Bonhoeffer was killed. He described what he saw:\u201cThe prisoners were taken from their cells. The judgments were read out to them. Through the open door in one room, I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer. He was on the floor praying to his God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed. He believed and was so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a prayer. Then he climbed the steps to the gallows. He was brave and calm. He died in a few seconds. In the almost 50 years that I have worked as a doctor, I have never seen a man die so completely accepting of the will of God.\u201dThere are many Christians who would have encouraged Bonhoeffer to find a non\u2013violent form of protest. But many would say that his actions are different from other acts of violence. That is because he was moved by Jesus Christ\u2019s command to help the poor and the suffering and those who cannot help themselves.Dietrich Bonhoeffer was not trying to tell people that all acts of violence are good as long as you feel God is behind you. Instead, he was one man in one situation trying to decide what was best. He was not sure he was doing the right thing. He had doubt and worry that he was wrong. But he was willing to accept the results of his actions, both for his body and for his soul.We began this program by asking if you would ever kill someone. Now, put yourself in Bonhoeffer\u2019s position. If you had the chance to kill a single person and save the lives of millions of people, would you do it? If you say \u201cno\u201d then what would you do? Nothing? These are not easy questions. Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cArt is, and always was, at the service of man. Our ancestors created their myths and told their stories for a human purpose. Any good story, any good novel, should have a message. It should have a purpose.\u201dThese words are from Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe. As a young man Achebe grew up in Igbo Nigerian culture. He saw the beauty and deep tradition of African people. But, when he looked at popular culture he saw something different. Some films and books from around the world showed African people as foolish or stupid. Achebe believed this was very wrong. He believed it was bad for African people. And in fact, it was bad for the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Chinua Achebe.Many people consider Chinua Achebe to be the \u2018father of modern African literature.\u2019 That is, he began a very important movement. He affected all of Africa with the novels, or books, he wrote.Achebe was born in Nigeria in 1930. His full name was Albert Chinualumogu Achebe. His parents named him in honor of Prince Albert, in England. Achebe\u2019s father was a teacher in a missionary school. And his parents were strong Christians. But they also taught him many values of the surrounding traditional Igbo culture.Achebe was a skilled student. At university he studied English, history, and theology, or faith. He also studied broadcasting. At university, Achebe also rejected his given British name, Albert. Instead he took his middle name \u2013 an African name \u2013 Chinua. After university Achebe travelled in Africa and America. He also worked in radio and was a teacher.But in 1958 Achebe made a permanent mark on the world. He wrote a book called \u201cThings Fall Apart.\u201d Today this book appears in more than 50 languages. It has sold more than 11 million copies. This book began a new kind of writing about Africa.\u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d is the story of a very successful African man. His name is Okonkwo. In the story, Okonkwo is a leader in his village. But after a terrible accident, he must leave his village. \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d tells about Okonkwo\u2019s life. It tells Okonkwo\u2019s religious beliefs and his traditions. It tells about his children, and the way the people in his village live.This seems like a very normal story. And it is a very normal story. That is why it is so important. The characters in the book are very real.\u00a0 Achebe showed the world what African people really felt, and said, and how they acted. This was a very new way to write stories about any African people.Achebe writes stories about Africa for a particular reason. For a long time, Achebe was interested in language. He listened to the people around him in Nigeria. They loved language. He heard them speak with \u201cgreat eloquence.\u201d They spoke beautifully. But Achebe did not see the same sort of eloquence and beauty from African people in modern literature of the time.A popular writer of the time was Joseph Conrad. One of his most famous books is called \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201d He wrote it in 1902. The story tells of a European man and his travels in parts of Africa. In those days many Europeans called Africa \u2018the dark continent.\u2019 Many believed that African people were not intelligent. They looked at them like animals. They believed the ceremonies and traditions of the Africans were foolish, and even evil. Some people believed that Joseph Conrad\u2019s book showed Africans in this way.Achebe tells about the longest group of words said by an African character in \u2018Heart of Darkness.\u2019 The character says only eight words. And he is not very eloquent. The African man says: \u201cCatch him! Give him to us! \u2026 Eat him.\u201d The African man who says this is a cannibal. He is looking for someone to eat. In other parts of the novel this man does not even speak. He shouts in high tones like an angry bird and makes animal noises.Achebe saw this short speech as an  to the people of Africa. So, he wanted to do something different. In an interview with Lorene Cary at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Achebe tells why he wanted to write a book about his people. He says:The people I was writing about wanted their story told. They people of my village wanted their story told. I wanted my story told. I was very young, but I had begun to read other people\u2019s stories. And I was beginning to wonder: where was mine?\u201dAchebe believed that no one had told the real story of the real people of Africa. Africans in literature did not seem human. These stories lacked the beautiful language Achebe heard around him. And he felt that taking away this language took worth away from Africans. He told Lorene Cary,\u201cWhen I am talking about my story, giving me back my story, I mean giving Africans back the story in which we are human. No matter how damaged or bad we are as humans. We cannot give language to some people and take it away from others. \u2026 That is what \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d is about. What I say must be true. I cannot act as if the Africans I am writing about are angels \u2013 that they are perfect. They are not. I have to say that they are human\u2026 I lived in the village and I knew the people of the village. They were not people without language.\u201dAchebe\u2019s books test old ways of thinking about African people. He believes that language and literature greatly influence people. In the past, bad representations of Africa and Africans influenced people all around the world. These bad representations even influenced Africans themselves. They started to believe they were not as modern or as good as white European cultures. But Achebe writes books to show the African cultures as they really are. He educates foreign readers. And he encourages African readers. He helps his people understand how valuable their culture is.Through the years, Achebe has written many novels, essays, and poems. And he has received many literature awards. His writings have influenced and inspired people all over the world.\u00a0You can read \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d in English.

It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.On the 7th of January 1943, an old man died. He was in a room at the New Yorker Hotel.\u00a0 The man had lived alone in this hotel room for the past ten years. Outside, the city of New York was full of lights. These lights were the result of an idea the old man had had many years before. This man was once famous for his idea. But many people had forgotten about the old man. No one seemed to care. The man died alone and with very little money. He was the great inventor Nikola Tesla.Tesla was an extremely  man. He had many new scientific ideas \u2013 ideas that would change the world. One writer called Tesla \u201cThe Man Who Invented the Twentieth Century.\u201d However, many people do not know the name Nikola Tesla. Why is this? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the life and work of Nikola Tesla.Nikola Tesla was born on the 10th of July 1856. He was from what is now the country of Croatia. His father was a priest. His mother was an inventor. She invented and made tools for her house work.From a very young age, Tesla was interested in . At this time, scientists had discovered electricity. However, they were still trying to understand how to best use it. As a young boy, Tesla had a dream or goal. He knew about the great waterfall, , in the United States. At Niagara Falls, a large river flows over a cliff. It drops more than 50 meters! Tesla wanted to turn this great waterfall into electricity. This was not a normal dream for a young boy. But Tesla was not a normal boy!Tesla was a very good student. He was particularly good at mathematics and language learning. In fact, Tesla knew six languages! Tesla studied at many different universities. However, he did not have the money to finish his studies.In 1881, one of the first  exchanges opened in Europe. It was in Budapest. Tesla moved there and got a job. It was here that Tesla first thought of the idea that would become his greatest invention. It was the alternating current or AC induction motor.In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America. He went to work for Thomas Edison. Edison was also a great inventor. He too was experimenting with how to best transport the power of electricity. But Tesla worked for Edison for less than a year. Tesla was sure his AC motor was the best way to capture and transport the power of electricity. However, Edison thought his way of using direct current or DC was better. Edison thought that AC was not safe. He did all he could to stop Tesla from developing his idea.However, a wealthy investor and engineer named George Westinghouse decided to support Tesla. Westinghouse helped Tesla get patents. These official papers kept other people from copying Tesla\u2019s many ideas. Soon, the scientific community accepted Tesla\u2019s way of using AC to capture and transport electricity. It was more powerful than DC and it was proved safe.In 1895, Tesla achieved his childhood dream. He designed the first hydroelectric power plant using the energy of the Niagara Falls.\u00a0 And he did it using the AC motor. This achievement ended Tesla\u2019s long battle with Edison. Tesla had won. Today, AC is the way electricity is transported all over the world. In fact, without it, you would not be able to listen to this programme.After the success of AC, Tesla became well-known. He travelled and spoke to many scientists about his inventions and ideas. Tesla also liked to demonstrate his ideas for crowds of people. He built a large laboratory where he did amazing things with lights and electricity. He would produce large lightning bolts, like the bright lights in a storm. And he used electricity to produce light without any wires.Tesla was a very interesting man. He was over six feet tall and was very good looking. He had many famous friends, including the great American writer Mark Twain. He liked to wear nice clothes. He also enjoyed eating food at the best restaurants.But many people thought Tesla was a little bit strange. He always counted things. He also liked to put things in order. For example, he would organize a group of glasses by size before he drank from them. Tesla also had an unusual interest in . Tesla loved these large birds which are common in New York.In March of 1895, Tesla\u2019s laboratory burned down. He had to start much of his research all over again. Tesla continued to invent and think of new ideas. But he was less successful and famous.Many people did not recognize that particular inventions were really Tesla\u2019s ideas. For example, people usually think of Guglielmo Marconi as the inventor of radio. However, Marconi used many of Tesla\u2019s ideas about long distance radio in his work. Tesla argued that Marconi was not the real inventor of radio. And after Tesla\u2019s death, the United States courts decided that Marconi did use Tesla\u2019s ideas. But by this time people had forgotten about the debate. Tesla also achieved important inventions in other areas. He did important work on medical x-rays, remote control and wireless technology.As Tesla got older, he continued to invent new ideas and theories. But he also became more and more sad. People like George Westinghouse no longer gave money to support him. Many people did not understand Tesla\u2019s new ideas. He gave speeches about creating electrical power from the earth\u2019s atmosphere. He also talked about ways that wireless electricity and communication could power things all over the world! Now, some people say Tesla\u2019s ideas were \u2018ahead of his time.\u2019 To the people of his time, these ideas sounded insane. However, some of his ideas are supported by modern research and technology.Tesla\u2019s last years were lonely and sad. He received many awards, but received very little money for this work. He lived alone in a hotel room. His best friends were the pigeons he loved so much. When he died in 1943, he was no longer famous. He felt forgotten. Today, not many people know the name of Nikola Tesla. But his inventions and ideas affect our lives every day!The writer of this programme was Shelagh Godwin. The producer was Luke Haley.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cAs I walk toward the mountain, I try to understand what has gone wrong. This does not help. I am in good shape. I have not run too fast. I ate and drank liquids. Normally, I am great at knowing what my body can do. But today I have lost all desire. I do not have foot blisters, legs cramps, painful knees, or any usual running problems. But my brain has gone away. It will not tell my legs to get going. I cannot explain this. I am only reporting.\u201dThis was written by Amby Burfoot for Runner\u2019s World Magazine. He was writing about the Comrades Marathon. Many people consider this race to be the greatest running race in the world. But the Comrades Marathon is not only about professional runners. The Comrades Marathon celebrates normal people doing something amazing. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Comrades Marathon.The Comrades Marathon began with Vic Clapham. During World War I, Clapham saw pain, death, and struggle. From 1914 to 1918 he served in the South African Army. Many people think World War I happened only in Europe. But there was fighting in places like South Africa as well.Clapham saw a lot of suffering. But he also saw men come together and support each other. He was amazed by how the soldiers dealt with such difficult conditions. When the war ended, Clapham wanted to honor all the men who died. But he did not want to just build a statue. He wanted to test people\u2019s strength and courage.He decided to hold a running race. It would be a 56-mile run from the city of Pietermaritzburg to the city of Durban. He would be honouring the men he fought with \u2014 his comrades. So, he called it the Comrades Marathon.At first, he had trouble. Many people thought it would be too long and too difficult. Clapham disagreed. His comrades had been normal people. They had carried heavy equipment and marched all over Africa. And he believed that trained athletes could run 56 miles. So, the first Comrades Marathon was held on May 24, 1921. There were only 34 runners.The Comrades has been run every year since then, except during World War II. It has become more and more popular. Today, the Comrades must limit the number of runners. In 2019, only 25,000 could run in the race.The Comrades is not just any race. There are many traditions that set Comrades above other races. First there is the distance. Fifty-six miles is longer than two marathons! Running a marathon is amazing. Running two together? That\u2019s something special.Most races run the same direction every year, but not Comrades. One year it goes from Pietermaritzburg to Durban. Then the next year it goes the other way, from Durban back to Pietermaritzburg. You can run Comrades twice and have a different experience each time.Also, there are different coloured race numbers, or bibs. Runners wear these bibs on their shirts. If you finish nine Comrades you get a special yellow bib. If you finish more than ten, then you get a green bib. The number on this bib becomes yours forever. No one else will ever get that number. You have earned it.Finally, the race ends at 12 hours. When the clock gets close to 12 hours, the race director walks to the finish line. He stands with his back to the runners and watches the clock. As the time gets closer, the crowd goes wild. They cheer people to run faster. Runners must push themselves to finish. There are no excuses. Twelve hours after the race began, the race director stops the race. The Comrades is over. Those who finish in 12 hours and one second will get nothing. No medal. No recognition. No record of their effort. However, Burfoot writes:\u201cThere is something for the first non-finisher. He or she becomes an immediate hero. She is on television and on the front of every newspaper. To many South Africans, the Comrades runner who goes all that distance, for nothing, is more of a symbol than the winner. That is another great tradition. It is one I think we all can accept, even if we are not sure what it means.\u201dThe Comrades shares this spirit in other ways too. South Africa used to be governed by the laws of Apartheid. Apartheid laws segregated, or separated, the people with dark skin from people with light skin. It was illegal for a person to marry someone with another skin color. Apartheid laws favored the white race. Life for non-white South Africans was very difficult under Apartheid.In these conditions, the Director of the Comrades Marathon wanted to make the race an international event. So, in 1975, the Comrades Marathon changed its rules. They said women could run with men, black people could run with white people, and young people could run with old people. In a few years, many more black and female runners were running the Comrades Marathon. This was 20 years  the end of the Apartheid laws.Is the Comrades Marathon the greatest footrace in the world? There are strong reasons to think so. The strongest reason is that Comrades is about something more than running \u2013 especially for South Africans. Writer Jacob Dlamini explains:\u201cThe Comrades is a way to tell the history of modern South Africa. Comrades tells us a lot about who we are and what we are able to do. It is a race started as a celebration of human ability. But it limited that celebration to only a few until the 1970s. Now it is a race that shows the best of what South Africa has to offer. By doing that, it permits South Africans to compete against the very best in the world. More importantly, the Comrades puts such mental and physical demands on its runners that differences of race, ethnicity, gender and class are meaningless. The hills of Comrades do not care how much money you have, what kind of hair you have, or what language you speak.\u201dDo you think Comrades is a good test of courage?

I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Do you like to be afraid? Many people around the world enjoy feeling fear. They love telling and listening to frightening stories. Many cultures tell different kinds of scary stories. Some involve creatures beyond what we can see and feel. Others are about dangerous monsters, like evil spirits. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on scary stories and why people tell them.The feeling of fear is a strong one. Being frightened creates extreme feelings in the body. When a person is scared, her heart beats faster. Her senses like touch and hearing might become stronger for a short amount of time. Some people tell scary stories to experience these extreme feelings.But telling scary stories can also have a more complex purpose. Scary stories are often fantasy \u2013 they are not real. They only happen in a person\u2019s imagination. Telling frightening stories is safe. But it lets people think about what they fear in real life.For example, scary stories can be about frightening places. These places are real, but there are stories about them. One of these places is in Mexico. In English it is called \u201cThe Island of the Dolls.\u201d Dolls are toys shaped like human children. Sometimes they can make a person feel strange and afraid. On this island, there are thousands of dolls. They hang from trees everywhere. They are missing body parts and they are dirty. Adam Navis tells the story of the Island of the Dolls.Don Julian Santana Barrera lived alone on a small island. One day something horrible happened. Don Julian found a little girl floating in the water. The little girl had drowned! A little while later he saw her doll floating down the river.Don Julian felt very bad about the little girl. So he hung her doll from a tree, to remember her. He believed the girl became a ghost, and visited Don Julian. He believed he heard strange whispers and sad sounds in the darkness. The girl\u2019s ghost wanted him to find more dolls. So Don Julian continued to hang more and more dolls from the trees.When he died, his nephew found Don Julian\u2019s body in the river. It was the same place where he had found the girl. Today, there are still dolls everywhere on the island.This story may make a person feel strange and afraid. It just seems wrong. But scary stories can also have a particular purpose. They can teach a lesson. Fear can influence behaviour. This is the case in a story from Japan. Bruce Gulland tells the story of the Jikininki.It is late at night in a small village in Japan. A man named Muso is sleeping. He has travelled all day. Finally, he has found a room to stay for the night. But in the middle of the night, a boy wakes Muso. \u201cWe need to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy?\u201d Muso asks sleepily. The boy answers: \u201cThere has been a death.\u201d The boy is shaking with fear. He continues: \u201cYou are a stranger here, and do not know. Frightening things happen in this village after a death. So we must leave.But Muso does not leave. He is a priest. It is his duty to say prayers over the dead. Later that night, Muso sees a spirit. As Muso watches, the spirit does something very horrible. It eats the dead body. Muso watches, too frightened to move. He has seen a Jikininki \u2013 a kind of evil spirit.Later in the story, Muso finds the Jikininki. He discovers it is the spirit of a greedy priest. The priest stole money from dead bodies when he was alive. As punishment for his evil acts, he became a Jikininki. At the end of the story Muso frees him. But the greedy priest suffered as a Jikininki for 100 years.The story of the Jikininki teaches a simple lesson about greed. But some writers also like to tell scary stories about more complex ideas. A very famous example is by an English writer named Mary Shelley. There are no spirits, or magic in this story. It is about a normal person \u2013 a scientist. Christy VanArragon tells the story of Frankenstein:Victor Frankenstein was a very intelligent scientist. But he wanted to do impossible things. In his experiments he learned how to give life to non-living things. Using this knowledge, he created a creature from old, dead, body parts. And then he gave it life! The creature was intelligent. It could speak, read and write. But the creature was also very ugly. So Victor told it to leave.The creature only wanted a friend. But everywhere it went, people were frightened of it. They thought the creature was evil. It began to hate Victor Frankenstein for giving it life. So it hurt Victor. It even killed his wife. At the end of the book, Victor dies. The creature cries over Victor\u2019s body. Victor only wanted to bring good things to the world. But by creating the creature, he destroyed both it and himself. The creature runs away and is lost forever.The story of Frankenstein is not as frightening as other scary stories. Instead, it questions the things people fear. The creature looks very frightening. So people believe it is evil. But it does not want to be a monster.So, why do scary stories continue to be popular around the world? Neil Gaimon is a British writer of scary stories. In a 2014 TED talk he explained another reason why he thinks scary stories can be good for people. He said:\u201cFear is a wonderful thing in small amounts. You begin the scary story knowing you will come out after a time in safety. It is always good to know that you are still here, still safe. You know that nothing strange has happened, not really. It is good to be a child again, for a little while. It is good not to fear real scary things like governments or relationship or money problems or distant wars. But instead we can fear things that do not exist.\u201dDo you like to be frightened? What kind of scary stories have you heard? Tell us what you think! You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.We begin today\u2019s program with a story.Kwesuka sukela \u2013 once upon a time \u2013 there lived a woman named Manzandaba and her husband Zenzele. They lived in a traditional home in a small Zulu village. At night they sat around their open fire with their many children. \u201cMama\u201d the children cried. \u201cSifuna izindaba! We want stories! Tell us some stories, mother!\u201d Manzandaba would think and think. But she and Zenzele did not know any stories. They asked their neighbors, but their neighbors did not know any stories. They listened to the wind. But the wind did not know any stories. There were no stories anywhere.Can you imagine a world without stories? This story we just began is a story from the Zulu people of Southern Africa. It is a well-known imaginary story. It tells how all stories began. In the story, stories were a gift to a mother long ago.Stories are important to every culture in the world. They are a way to entertain us, teach us, preserve our culture, and to help us make good choices. Around the world, people celebrate the telling of stories on World Storytelling Day in the month of March. So today, we will celebrate this day with you! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on stories. First, we continue the story of Manzandaba.Manzandaba did not know any stories. So, she kissed her husband and children goodbye and left her home to find some stories. Manzandaba decided to ask every animal she met if they knew any stories. She asked each animal. Some were kind, but some were not kind at all. Some of the animals lied to her and said they had stories they would not share. Other animals tried to help her by giving advice. But none of the animals had any stories for Manzandaba.Finally, a big sea turtle offered to take Manzandaba to the Spirit People under the sea. She held onto the turtle\u2019s shell very tightly until she reached the very bottom of the ocean. The Spirit People agreed to give Manzandaba stories if she would give them a picture of her home on the dry land. Manzandaba gave them the picture. They gave her a large, beautiful shell. They told her \u201cWhenever you want a story, just hold this shell to your ear and you will have one!\u201d When Manzandaba returned to land, her children asked her:\u201cSifuna izindaba! We want stories! Tell us some stories, mother!\u201d Manzandaba sat down on the shore. She held the shell to her ear, and she began: Kwesuka sukela\u2026And this is how stories began.World Storytelling day is not just a celebration of good stories. It is a celebration of the art of storytelling. Throughout history there have been many famous storytellers. William Shakespeare. Rabindranath Tagore. Aesop. Nasreddin Hodja. These are all famous storytellers from around the world. They make stories with interesting characters and wonderful events.But some storytellers use stories to teach good advice or give a moral lesson. Even simple stories can have big lessons. Usually these stories are called fables. This is the story of the Wise Old Man.In a village, there was a very old man. Every day, people came to the old man complaining about the same problems. One day the old man told them a joke. Everyone laughed and laughed. After a few minutes, the old man told them the joke again. A few of the people smiled. The old man told them the joke a third time. This time, no one laughed at all.The old man told them: \u201cYou cannot laugh at the same joke over and over. So, why are you always crying about the same problem?\u201dIn this story, the wise old man tries to teach people a lesson. Worrying and complaining cannot solve any problems. It will only waste your time and energy.Our final story also has a moral meaning behind it. It comes from Nigeria. This is the story of The Two-Colored Coat.Two boys were great friends. They promised they would remain friends forever. When they got older, they built their houses opposite each other. A small path formed a border between their two farms.One day a trickster came from the village. He decided to play a trick on the friends. He clothed himself in a two color coat. One side of the coat was red. And the other side was blue. The trickster walked along the narrow path between the houses of the friends. The two men were working opposite each other in their fields. The trickster made noise as he passed. He wanted to make sure each man looked up and saw him passing.At the end of the day, one friend said to the other:\u201cDid you see that man today with his beautiful red coat?\u201d\u201cDo you mean the blue coat?\u201d The other replied.\u201cNo. His coat was red. I saw the man clearly as he walked between us!\u201d said the first.\u201cYou are wrong!\u201d said the other man. \u201cI saw it too. And it was blue!\u201d\u201cI know what I saw!\u201d said the first man. \u201cThe coat was red!\u201d\u201cYou do not know anything!\u201d the second man replied angrily. \u201cIt was blue!\u201dThe two men argued over and over. They insulted each other. And then, they began beating each other!The trickster returned. He watched the two fighting men. He listened to their shouts. \u201cOur friendship is over!\u201dThe trickster laughed. And he showed them his two-colored coat. The men were angry! They shouted:\u201cWe have lived side by side all our lives \u2013 like brothers! Now you have started a war between us!\u201dThe trickster replied,\u201cDo not blame me for the fight. Both of you are wrong. And both of you are right. What each one saw was true. You are fighting because you only looked at my coat from your own side of the path. You did not think there was another way of looking at the situation.\u201dSimple stories can have deep truths. They can show us life in a different way. They can teach us how to live. They are one of the most ancient traditions surviving today. Think about a story that you have learned from. Is it an old story or a new one?What is your favorite story? Do you enjoy telling stories?

I\u2019m Katy Blake.And I\u2019m Mike Procter. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.More than five centuries ago, two armies fought a great battle. The battle ended years of civil war in England. On one side of the battle field was the army of King Richard III. On the other side was the army of Henry Tudor. Henry wanted to become king.During the battle, King Richard saw a chance to kill Henry. Richard rode his horse quickly toward Henry.\u00a0 He killed many of Henry\u2019s soldiers. But then, King Richard\u2019s horse became stuck in the wet battlefield. The king fell. He fought hard, but there were too many enemy soldiers around him. The soldiers crushed Richard\u2019s head and killed him. Later, they carried his dead body through the streets for all the people to see.Religious leaders finally buried Richard\u2019s body in a nearby church. But years later the church was destroyed. And Richard\u2019s body was forgotten. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the recent discovery of Richard III\u2019s body. This news about his death has caused many people to look again at his life.Richard III was the last king of England to die in battle. His body did not receive honour. He was not buried in Westminster Abbey, the great Christian church in London where many English kings are buried. He was also not buried where he wanted to be. Richard wanted to be buried at his family home near the ancient city of York. Instead King Richard was buried in the city of Leicester, near the battle field where he died. And there he lay, forgotten.Hundreds of years went by. The church building had been destroyed long ago. The city around Richard\u2019s body had changed. No one knew where his bones were. Then, in 2012, a team of experts began a new search.\u00a0 These archaeologists were looking for the body of King Richard. But they were not looking in a place that would honour a king. The team was digging under a car park, a place where people leave their cars.Soon, the team found human bones. Immediately, they thought it was King Richard. They thought this because the skeleton\u2019s spine was unusual.\u00a0 This bone in the middle of a human\u2019s back is usually straight. However, the spine they found was bent or crooked. And history books had long told of how King Richard\u2019s spine was crooked.The archaeologists wanted to be sure it was King Richard. So, they performed many tests on the skeleton. Many things proved that the bones were Richard III\u2019s, including DNA tests.However, many people believed it was Richard just because of the reports about the crooked spine. For hundreds of years, people had remembered Richard for this. Artists painted pictures of Richard with one of his shoulders higher than the other. And writers told stories of \u2018crooked\u2019 Richard. However, crooked has another meaning too. For example, people say that criminals are crooked. This means that their character is not straight and honest.Many people say that Richard III was a crooked king \u2013 both in the way he looked and in his character. This is how England\u2019s greatest writer, William Shakespeare, described King Richard. Over 400 years ago, Shakespeare wrote a famous play about Richard III. At this time, many people believed that a disability was a sign of evil. So Shakespeare made Richard even more disabled in his play. His character did not just have a crooked back. He also had an arm that did not work. In the play, Richard also murdered his brother. And he made secret plans to steal power.Shakespeare\u2019s play is not historically true. However, his work has shaped many people\u2019s opinions of King Richard III. Shakespeare wrote his drama when the granddaughter of Henry Tudor ruled England. And here is the problem. Most of our information about Richard III comes from people who supported Henry Tudor and his family.There is another famous story about Richard\u2019s crooked character. This is not a story from literature. It is a mysterious story from history. But no one knows the full truth. It is the story of \u2018The Princes in the Tower.Richard\u2019s older brother, Edward, had been king before him. He died, but his two sons were too young to rule the country. So Richard took his brother\u2019s place. He was supposed to protect the young boys from their enemies. He was supposed to take care of the country, until his oldest nephew could rule.But the boy princes disappeared. They were never seen again. Richard became king instead. Followers of Henry Tudor said Richard killed his brother\u2019s sons. Others believe that Richard cared for the boys, but that Henry had them killed when he became king. However, what exactly happened is still a mystery today.We do know some facts about Richard. Richard lived in a dangerous time. Powerful men spent much time plotting against each other. And he did have many of his strongest enemies killed.But other facts do not match the stories about Richard\u2019s crooked character. While his brother Edward was king, Richard was loyal to him. As a soldier, he fought for Edward in many battles. Richard also had a loving relationship with his wife and his own son.We also know that his people loved Richard. He gave money to universities and churches. He did many things to help the poor. This does not seem like the kind of person who would murder his brother\u2019s children!We may never know the truth about Richard III. The history of his life seems to be crooked too! However, like all people, Richard was probably a mix of good and evil. This is exactly what Philippa Langley believes. Langley is a film writer. She has long believed that Richard was not as evil as many people think. She is part of an organization that defends Richard\u2019s character. And she was one of the people responsible for finding Richard\u2019s body. Langley hopes the discovery will create discussion about his life. Langley told the New York Times newspaper,\u201cThe truth will turn out to be somewhere in between. Richard III was a man of his time.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Listen to these stories. Are they lies or truth?Humans only use ten percent of their brains.Did you know that if you are in the UK and you dial 999 and hang up, it will charge your mobile telephone?There is a small amount of drugs found on every American dollar bill.Swimming after eating will cause a pain in your stomach and you will die.Has anyone ever told you a story like this that sounded false, but could have been true? Probably that person was telling you an urban legend \u2014 like the ones we just told. Urban legends are stories that many people tell. They are often connected to city, or urban, life. They are stories that sound so strange that it is difficult to believe they are true. But they are stories that  be true \u2013 so we want to believe them. Most people will share these stories to many people.Urban legend stories spread quickly. They pass by word of mouth from person to person. People tell them over and over again. And they are told over many years. Today, they are spread through social media. When you hear an urban legend, the story usually starts something like this, \u201cA friend of a friend of mine told me this story \u2026\u201dUrban legends are never first-hand stories. That is, the person telling you the story was not there. He did not experience the events of the story himself. He is only telling you what he heard from someone else. Some urban legends last many years, and there is no way to know if they are true!So, what urban legends have you heard or seen? Have you heard that restaurants use worms, a kind of insect, to make their hamburgers? Or how about this? Did you hear that every human will eat eight insects a year in their sleep? If you sleep with your mouth open, these horrible little creatures can walk right into your mouth and down into your stomach! What do you think about that? How many insects do you think you have eaten this year?Some social scientists study urban legends. They say that these stories show what a community is concerned about. For example, urban legends about crime show that a community is concerned about crime. Stories about abuse or corruption show that a community is concerned about honesty in the police and government. Listen to this urban legend and try to imagine what this community was concerned about.One night a woman had just finished her shopping at the market. She carried the bags to her car. When she got to her car, she struggled to open the door. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain on her foot. A man was hiding underneath her car! He cut her foot with a knife. The woman could not run away because of the deep cut. The man pushed the woman to the ground and stole her car.As you probably imagined, this community was concerned about crime against women. This story has been told to many women. It has made some women very afraid of going out alone at night. For other women, the story just encourages them to be careful if they are alone at night.Many people think that all urban legends are false \u2013 that they are not true at all. But not all urban legends are false. Sometimes these stories have some truth in them or a moral lesson that can be learned. We are going to tell another urban legend. This story could be true, or it could be false \u2013 but it has a very important lesson about how we should live. The story begins with two young men, leaving school at the end of the day.Bill was walking home from school. It was Friday. He was excited about the weekend. As he crossed the street, he saw John \u2013 a new student at the school. John was carrying all of his books. But why? Was he planning to study all weekend?Then Bill saw another group of students. They walked over to John. They pulled his books out of his hands and shouted mean words. Bill was angry. He ran over to John and helped him gather his books from the ground. He told John,\u201cDo not worry John. Those students are stupid. They do not know what they are doing.\u201dJohn looked at Bill and smiled gratefully. He thanked Bill. The two boys walked home together and talked. Bill asked about all the books, but John just said that he hoped to do some work at home.After that night, they became good friends. They spent a lot of time together playing football and studying. They stayed at the same school for several years. John became very successful at school. And he had many other friends too.When it was time for graduation, John came to talk to Bill. He thanked Bill for his friendship. Then, he talked about the day they met. He told Bill that he had planned to kill himself. He was carrying all of his books so that his mother would not have to collect them from the school. But instead, Bill had been there. He showed John true friendship and care. Bill had saved him. Bill was very surprised. He had never known this story. But now he understood John\u2019s grateful smile. And he understood something else too \u2013 the power of friendship.Have you heard this story before? Sometimes the details are different \u2013 in some stories, John gives a speech to the whole school, thanking Bill. In others, the boys only meet one time. But the point is the same \u2013 one person can make a difference through kindness and care. Even though we do not know the truth of the events, that message is definitely true!You should not always believe everything you hear.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Do you know the story of Santa Claus? It is one of the most popular Christmas stories. He brings toys and gifts to good girls and boys. He flies in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer. The story of Santa Claus has changed over the years. It has been told in books, films, and music.In 1939 Robert L. May wrote a new story about Santa Claus. This story soon became a well-known part of the story, or legend, of Santa Claus. This story has now been told in books and films. It is also a song. The song has even become one of the most popular Christmas songs of all time. Do you recognize it? Today\u2019s Spotlight tells the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.Real reindeer live in groups in forests. They live in very cold places. They have large antlers made of bone on their heads. But in this story, reindeer can also fly! They guide Santa\u2019s sleigh on the night before Christmas.Rudolph was a young reindeer. He wanted to play games and climb trees with other reindeer. But the other reindeer did not let him. Instead, they called him names. That is because Rudolph was not like all the other reindeer. Their noses were black or brown. But his nose was red. And it was like a bright light. A bright, red, light. The other reindeer would say,\u201cHa ha! Look at Rudolph! Look at his nose! It is as red as an apple! But it is much too big! It is so bright that I cannot even look at it!\u201dThese words made Rudolph cry. He knew that what they said was true. Still, he was a good reindeer. He listened to his parents. He tried to obey what they told him to do. But he was very lonely.One year, on the day before Christmas, Rudolph felt . He went to sleep, knowing that Santa would come that night.But Santa was having trouble. There was very bad weather. There was snow and fog. This would make it difficult for him to see where he was going. He would not see the stars or the moon. He would not know which way to go. He hoped he would be able to use house lights to guide his way. He was worried that he would not be able to reach all the boys and girls. But he called to his team of flying reindeer to come to him.\u201cCome Dasher! Come Dancer! Come Prancer and Vixen! Come Comet! Come Cupid! Come Donner and Blitzen!\u201dSanta loaded up his sleigh with toys and gifts. He connected each reindeer so they could pull together. Then off they all flew into the air. It took all of Santa\u2019s skill not to get lost. But they crashed into the tops of trees. They almost hit an airplane as it flew through the clouds. Santa was able to continue to leave presents by using the lights from houses. But as house lights went out, it got darker and darker.The next house he visited was Rudolph\u2019s. It was very dark now. Santa fell down and hurt his knee. He fell down again. Now he was very worried that he would not be able to continue. Then he entered Rudolph\u2019s room to leave a present. To his surprise he found light. It was not a lamp. It was a nose! This gave Santa a wonderful idea. He woke Rudolph from his sleep. Rudolph could not believe what he was seeing. Santa was here!Santa told Rudolph of all the trouble he was having. He told him about the fog and the dark. He told him about getting lost and crashing into trees. He told Rudolph how he was afraid that the boys and girls of the world would be sad if they woke without gifts. Then Santa asked Rudolph if he would help.\u201cYou may save the day. Your nose is so wonderful. I need you to help me tonight. To lead all my deer on the rest of our flight.\u201dRudolph smiled. No one had ever said that his nose was wonderful \u2013 especially not someone as important as Santa Claus. For a reindeer, the best honor was to be chosen to pull Santa\u2019s sleigh. Rudolph could not believe what was happening. He ran outside. He took his place in front of all the other reindeer.Soon, Santa was flying through the night again. Now he could go fast. Now they did not get lost or crash. They finished giving all the gifts just as the sun began to rise. All the other reindeer were just now waking up. But Rudolph was not in his bed! They wondered where he had gone.Then they heard the sound of bells. Santa and his reindeer flew out of the sky. Could it be? Was that Rudolph? Rudolph landed in front of the other reindeer. They had all called him names and not let him play with them. Now, Santa told all the reindeer that he had never seen a reindeer so brave as Rudolph. Santa told everyone that when it was dark or there was fog, Rudolph would lead the sleigh again.In fact, this Christmas, if you listen carefully, you may hear them call, as they drive out of sight: Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!The story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer has many versions. But in every story, one thing is the same. Rudolph learns to accept who he is. In the beginning, Rudolph has a part of himself that he does not like. He feels shame. But by the end of the story, it is that very thing that everyone celebrates!We are all like Rudolph in some ways. We all have things about ourselves that we feel shame about or do not like. But this Christmas, maybe we can be a little more like Rudolph. We can find a way to shine our light and make the world a little brighter.Tell us what you think about the story of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. What do you think the lesson of this story is?

I\u2019m Christy VanArragonAnd I\u2019m Joshua Leo. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Every day more people in the world use computers and other technology to communicate. Many books are now available on the internet. People write emails, and text messages, instead of letters. In many places, people do not even use physical money to pay for things any more. All these technologies are replacing one of the most important materials in history: paper. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on paper, its history and its importance in the world today.Many people believe that paper started with the ancient Egyptians. However, this is not exactly true. Instead, 5000 years ago, Egyptians used a material called papyrus. They made papyrus from the stems of river plants. They put these flat pieces together, to create a larger flat sheet. Ancient Egyptians wrote on these sheets like paper.But the paper we know today did not exist until 3000 years later. It was created in China. Before the invention of paper, people in China would write on pieces of bone, bamboo or costly cloth. No one knows who first invented paper. But history does tell us about one man who improved the process. It was in the year 105. A man named Cai Lun began to experiment. He used many materials to make paper. He took bark from the outside of trees, pieces of net normally used to catch fish, and pieces of cloth rags. He broke these materials down into very small pieces. He put all these materials into a large container of water, to mix them. Then he removed this material, using a screen. When he pressed out the water, all that was left was a thin sheet of paper. He presented this new way of making paper to the Emperor. The Emperor was very happy and gave Cai Lun much money.Paper quickly spread to other areas of the world. In the Middle East, people made paper thicker. They also made it easier to produce quickly. From the Middle East, paper travelled to Europe and then the Americas. For many years paper cost a lot of money and time to create. But in the 19th century, people began to use steam powered machines to create paper from wood. Paper is still made from wood today in large factories around the world.Paper changed the way people lived. Long ago, when paper was difficult to make, people only used paper for special purposes. Religious leaders would write holy words on it. Government officials would write important laws on it. Explorers drew maps of the world on it. But normal, common people did not use it. As paper became easier to make, it was used for more things. People wrapped it around gifts. Anyone could use paper to make notes and write down information. Paper was also used as money.Today people use paper for even more things. Paper cloths clean up dirt. Many products are sold in cardboard boxes made from paper. People drink water and other drinks out of paper cups.But this creates a new problem \u2013 the problem of waste. When we are done using paper, it does not just disappear. Some paper can be recycled \u2013 it can be made into new paper. But a lot of paper simply becomes waste, or garbage. It is burned for energy, or stored in large landfills. Paper does biodegrade, or break down over time but it does not happen quickly. As the paper breaks down it releases harmful gasses into the air. In the United States, paper makes up one third of all waste. In just that country, that is 85 million tons per year!But this is not the only problem that paper can cause. In the past, paper included materials from cloth, waste paper, and other fibres from plants. But today, most paper comes from trees. Many of these trees come from very old forests around the world. Today, only 20 percent of the world\u2019s ancient forests still exist. Around the world, every two seconds, people cut down more than 4,000 square meters of trees. And many of those trees became paper.These ancient forests cannot be replaced. Forests provide oxygen for animals and humans. They store the gas carbon dioxide, which can cause global warming. Cutting down trees can also destroy environmental systems. The birds, plants and animals that live there may also die. Some companies plant new trees when they cut down forests. But it takes a long time for new trees to grow. Often, these newly planted trees are all the same kind of tree. This is called a monoculture. A monoculture forest can get diseases easier. If one tree gets sick, all the same kind of trees get sick. When forests have many different kind of trees, they can resist disease easier.Creating the paper can also cause environmental problems. Large paper factories use chemicals to make paper white. They also use a lot of water to create the paper. The chemicals pollute the water. If the factories release the water without removing the chemicals, the water can then pollute rivers and lakes. The chemicals in the water can also cause health problems.So what can be done to help reduce the number of trees being cut down for paper? What can a person do to change their paper impact on the world?The first step is to try to use less paper. Could you clean with a cloth instead of paper? Can you use less paper in your office or home? Can you re-use the paper used to cover a gift?Next, look at the kind of paper you use. Most paper can be reused in some way. Old paper can be turned into new paper through recycling. By recycling paper like this, less trees have to be cut down. It takes less energy to recycle paper than it does to make new paper from trees. Are there ways to recycle paper where you live?Many companies make products from post-consumer materials. This means that instead of cutting down trees to make the paper products, they use recycled paper. Buying these recycled paper products can save a lot of trees, water and energy.In many places, people can also buy paper that comes from forests that are sustainably harvested. This means that when the trees in these forests are cut down, people make sure that it will not damage the environment of the forest.Paper has been an important part of history. It has made many things possible. And even though people are using less paper, it is still very important to us today. But it is up to us to make sure that paper does not harm the world. It is our responsibility to give it a positive future.The writer and producer of this program was Joshua Leo. The voices you heard were from the United States.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A small girl walks through the streets. She is cold and hungry. Where can she find help on a cold winter\u2019s day?\u201cMatches! Light your fires with my matches! Would you like to buy some matches sir? What about you madam? They are the best kind! Strike them against any wall! They will burn! Someone must want some matches \u2013 anyone?\u201dThe Little Match Girl is a popular story. Hans Christian Anderson wrote this story. He wrote many children\u2019s stories in the 1800s. People like to tell the story of the Little Match Girl during the Christmas season. Both adults and children enjoy it. But is it a sad story or a happy story? Liz Waid tells the story of the Little Match Girl.A cold wind blows across the town. People hurry along, holding their warm coats close to their bodies. It is a cold winter! They will be happy to get home to their warm fires and nice food. Street sellers count their money at the end of the day. But for the little match girl, there is no money to count. No one wants to buy her matches. So, she is afraid to go home. Her father will beat her for sure.The little girl walks across the street. The snow falls on her long hair. She looks up at the tall, beautiful houses as she passes. She can hear people laughing inside. The smell of food cooking rises in the air. The people are preparing their last meal before the New Year. The little match girl walks to a quiet street corner. She sits down, holding her knees. She tries to pull her feet under her body. They are so cold. She has no shoes or coat. Her feet are blue from walking on the cold ground. Maybe she should go home? But even her home is not warm. Her family has no money.The little girl puts her head in her hands. A tear wets the side of her face. If only she could be warm \u2013 for just a minute. Then, she has an idea \u2013 matches! She has her matches!Her father would be angry if she wasted any matches. But she only wants one, just one. Maybe it will warm her freezing fingers. The little girl gets a match. She strikes it against the wall \u2013 fire! The warm orange light shines in the darkness. The little girl looks hard at the small dancing fire. She imagines that she is sitting by a warm cooking oven. It seems so real! She can see the oven. She can feel its heat. She stretches her legs and warms her feet. How the fire burns! Then, the fire from the match goes out. The oven disappears. The little girl is once again in the cold darkness. Only the half-burnt match remains in her hand.The little girl is so sad. Her happiness had come and gone so quickly. Maybe she could burn one more match? She takes another. And she strikes it against the wall. Fire lights up her sad face. She smiles. This time, she sees the wall become thin. It is almost like paper. She can see through it! Behind it, she sees a room. Such beauty! There is a huge table with hot food on it! She can almost taste the hot food. She reaches out for a little to feed her hungry stomach. But suddenly the fire from the match goes out. Once more, everything disappears. Only the grey wall remains before her.So, the little girl strikes another match. The golden fire burns again. This time, she is under a huge Christmas tree! Beautiful bells and flowers hang from the tree. Lights shine from its green branches. It is the most beautiful tree she has ever seen! She reaches her hands toward the lights. Then, the match goes out. But the Christmas lights begin to change into stars in the sky. One of the stars falls back to earth.The little girl thinks to herself,\u201cSomeone must be dying\u201d.The little girl starts to think of her dead grandmother. Her grandmother told her that when a star falls from the sky, a soul goes up to God. She misses her grandmother so much. The little girl lights another match.This time, standing in the light, she sees her grandmother! Her grandmother was the only person who ever showed her love. She looks beautiful. The little girl cries:\u2018Grandmother! Take me with you! I know when the fire goes out you will disappear! Please take me with you!\u2019The little girl takes all the matches. One by one she strikes them against the wall. She burns them quickly, so the picture does not disappear. The light shines brighter and brighter. It is as bright as day. She sees her grandmother more clearly. Her grandmother has never been so beautiful. The little girl reaches out to her grandmother. Her grandmother stretches out her arms to receive the little girl.The grandmother takes the little girl in her arms. They fly together in joy high above the earth. There is no cold, hunger or fear. They are with God.In the corner on the street, the little girl is leaning against the wall. She has red cheeks and a smiling mouth. But she is frozen. The New Year\u2019s sun rises on the sad figure. The child sits there still and cold. She is holding a bundle of half-burned matches.Only a few people walk on the quiet streets. They stop at the street corner. They see a small body on the ground. The people comment, \u201cPoor thing. She was trying to keep warm,\u201dBut no one knew the beautiful things she had seen. They did not know how happy she was to be with her grandmother. She had gone happily into the New Year.The Little Match Girl is a popular story at Christmas time. It is an imaginary story. But people see many messages in it. Some people say the little match girl makes them think about people who have less than them. They think about people who may be poor or lonely at Christmas or the holidays. The story encourages them to help people in need.Other people see a message behind the pictures in the story. Each vision made the little match girl feel happy. But the picture she wanted to stay with her was the one of her grandmother. This was the only one that offered a different kind of happiness \u2013 love.Unconditional love is another message some people see in the story. The grandmother represents a love that does not die. This love carries the little girl to a place without pain or suffering. This makes some people think about God\u2019s love and heaven \u2013 especially at Christmastime. And they think of his love that will carry them to a better place one day \u2014 heaven.Have you heard this story before? Do you think this story was a sad story or a happy story?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine a large white horse. It has a long, pointed horn coming out of the middle of its head. It is gentle, but powerful. This creature seems to be surrounded by magic. It is full of majesty, grace, and beauty. It seems to shine with a silver-colored light. You probably already know what this imaginary creature is called. This is a unicorn.Unicorns are the magical one-horned creatures from myths and stories. People often imagine unicorns that look like the description above. Unicorns are imaginary. But they may be based on a true animal. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on unicorns.All over the world, people of all ages love to tell stories about unicorns. Unicorns have even inspired modern clothing fashion and art. But the unicorn has also become a very serious symbol. It represents hope and brightness to many people. Alice Fisher is a reporter for the Guardian Newspaper. She writes that people want to be open to new ideas. They want to believe in the possibility of a magic creature. She says that it is even more important in our modern times. She writes:\u201cEvery era we use myths and stories to help make sense of the world. In recent times people have used aliens, zombies and vampires. But in our uncertain times, we have chosen the unicorn \u2013 a symbol of hope and purity and strangeness.\u201dThe unicorn is a modern symbol. But this creature\u2019s story is very old. And it is not just one story. There is no single version of the unicorn. In the Middle Ages, European people believed unicorns were real. For them, the unicorn was a holy creature with great intelligence. It could heal wounds with a touch of its horn. But the unicorn was very difficult to catch. Only a pure person could see a unicorn for more than a moment.There are stories of unicorns that come from before the Middle Ages. In fact, there is a version of the unicorn in most cultures. Pliny the Elder was a writer from ancient Greece. He wrote some of the first books on natural history. In one of them, he describes a creature called the monoceros. It was a one-horned creature that lived in modern-day India.The monoceros had the body of a horse, the head of a stag, the feet of an elephant, and the tail of a wild pig. It had one black horn that grew out of the middle of its forehead. Pliny the elder said that people there hunted the monoceros \u2013 but they could never capture it. This animal was not real. But some people think the story of the monoceros inspired unicorn stories.The ancient Chinese told of a creature similar to the unicorn. It was called the Qilin. Some writers say it had scales like a snake. But it walked on four legs. It had hooves, like a horse. And it had a single horn growing from its head. The Qilin was very important in Chinese culture. It was very rare, so the people believed that the Qilin was lucky. It only appeared when a great king or holy person was born. Like the Unicorn, it was a very powerful magic animal. The stories are so similar that some western people call the Qilin a \u201cChinese unicorn.\u201dBut scientists have found evidence of a real creature with one horn. It was called the Elasmotherium. Elasmotherium was a huge creature that lived thousands of years ago. Scientists found its bones in modern-day Russia. Elasmotherium had long hair over its whole body. And it had a horn on its head the size of a person. It was a very powerful animal. People may have hunted them for food or their skin or horn.There are many other creatures like unicorns in stories from around the world. These stories are all similar. Some people believe that the unicorn may once have been a real animal, like Elasmotherium. People may have told stories about this real animal. Then, over time, the stories changed. People described the creature in more and more amazing ways. Over time, the unicorn creature of the story became different from the real animal.These stories had another purpose. Storytellers used them to teach lessons. And they shaped the animal to fit those teachings. Most people had never seen an animal like a unicorn. But it became part of a tradition. In this way, people did not forget the special power of these animals. Their power simply changed.In the modern world, most people do not believe they will ever see a creature like a unicorn. People are moving more and more to a scientific view of the world. But stories and myths are still valuable!Joel Dubois is a professor at the University of California at Sacramento. He teaches mythic storytelling. He says that many people think the word myth means stories are false. But he says science cannot tell us everything. On the university website Dubois writes how life is more than just science \u2013 the things we can see:\u201cPeople who share myths usually believe that reality is too complex to understand in one way. So they often use stories to show that complexity. For storytellers, stories about mythic worlds are more real in some ways than stories of facts we can observe with our own eyes. These storytellers know myths are about people in other worlds, living a special story. But they also point out hidden connections between myths and the normal people, places, things and events that people experience every day.\u201dMyths and stories are more about people than the creature that they talk about. Myths help us understand important times in our lives. They take us through difficult journeys. Myths can connect to people of any culture, in any time and place. The myth of the unicorn is one myth that will likely continue. It is a beautiful story in a troubling world.Do you have any myths in your family or community? What do they mean to you?

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.It was 1191. Duke Leopold the fifth, of Austria, was in a battle. After the battle he took his cloth coat off. It was covered in blood from the battle. But there was one stripe of white on his coat. It was white underneath the belt he was wearing around his waist. He liked the design. So, he made this design into a flag. It was red with a white stripe in the middle. It became the official design of the Austrian flag in the year 1919. And it is still Austria\u2019s flag today.Not every flag has such an exciting story in its history. But flags often do tell their own stories. They show meaning and inspire people. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on flags.People who study history believe that the first people to use flags lived in ancient Egypt. Egyptians made the first flags by tying long pieces of cloth to the end of very long poles. They carried these long poles when they fought in battles. They believed that their flags would please their gods and help them win the battles.The flags were also very useful. One soldier had the special job of carrying the flag. Generals watched the flag to know where their soldiers were. Flags also showed which way the wind was blowing. This helped soldiers aim their arrows.But flags had an even more important purpose in battle. Flags were a sign of the people. A flag showed other people who was fighting in a battle. Each group fighting in a battle carried a different colour flag.After a time, other cultures also began to use flags. And they added more than just colour. Flag designers started to put important pictures on the flags. These pictures, or symbols, on the flags represented ideas, people, or gods. Kings put their symbols on flags. When a king sent his people to battle, his enemies could see his symbol. They knew which king was attacking.Most flags use a common set of symbols. People have used these symbols for a very long time. For example, when you see a star on a flag, it usually represents unity. The number of stars on a flag may tell how many parts of something are united in some way. Other flags use symbols from nature, like leaves, trees, or animals. Some flags use religious symbols like crosses. Many Christian groups use a cross on their flags. Most flags are shaped like rectangles, or long squares. But some are square, like the flag of Switzerland.And flags are not just for countries! Groups like the United Nations, the Red Cross, and the European Union all have flags. Countries, states, cities, and even some small people groups have flags. But why are all these different flags needed?Flags are very good at communicating messages. But flags do not communicate with language. They do not need words to send a message. Instead, flags communicate with colors, symbols, and design. A person can read the message of a flag just by looking at it. Each flag\u2019s colour, symbols and design represent the people, government, land or ideas in a country or group. Think about your flag. You probably know what the colors and symbols on your flag mean. Here are a few examples of how flags use symbols and colour to send their messages.The symbol on the Lebanese flag is a Cedar tree. The cedar tree is a very popular tree in Lebanon. The flag tells other people that this is an important tree in Lebanon.Flags also represent values and ideas by using colour. The flag of Libya is only one colour. It is green. But this colour represents an important idea for the people of Libya. Green is a traditional colour of Islam. Islam is Libya\u2019s national religion. The green flag tells people who do not live in Libya that many people in Libya practice Islam.Flags may also use similar colors or designs to show unity with other nations around them. Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica all use the colors blue and white in their flags. Before 1838, these countries were joined together as the United Provinces of Central America. When they separated, each country chose a new flag design. But each new flag design was a version of the old design. These five separate South American flags all have a white stripe between two blue stripes. The white stripe represents land. And the blue stripes represent two oceans. But each flag has different symbols on it. So, the flags look similar, but they are all very different.Flags can also represent a group of countries that share a common goal or interest. Imagine the flag of the Olympic Games. The Olympic flag is white. It has no borders. In the middle there are five circles. They are blue, black, red, yellow, and green. The circles are linked together. There are five continents that take part in the Olympic Games. And each circle represents a continent. When people see the Olympic flag they see the message of the Olympics. They see that every continent is equal. And they see that the Olympic Games encourage unity.Flags can also tell a part of the history of a country or group. An example of this is the story about Austria\u2019s flag from the beginning of this program.On a flag, colour, symbol, and design combine to make something very meaningful. Flags are often a symbol for a country. When a person is proud of their country, their leader, or their group, they are happy to show people their flag. Flags unite people across a country, and sometimes around the world. Flags are a message that people can stand behind. Sometimes people will even die to protect and preserve a flag that sends a message they believe in.It is good for people to think about what they stand for and believe in. A flag is a very powerful thing. What does your flag represent? Do you think it is a good description of your country? What is your favorite flag? Tell us what you think.

I\u2019m Joshua Leo.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.On two days every year, most places on earth experience 12 hours of light, and 12 hours of darkness. These two days are the Spring Equinox and the Fall Equinox.On these two days something special happens in the ancient city of Chichen Itza. The sun shines on one of the large and ancient stone structures built here. On this particular structure, it appears as if a snake made of light is moving slowly down the wall.This special effect depends on exact measuring of the sun\u2019s position. Experts think that ancient people called the Maya built this structure, and the city, many years ago. Experts say that the Maya\u2019s knowledge of the sun\u2019s position is unusual.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the ancient city of Chichen Itza. This city is in southern Mexico. Thousands of years ago Chichen Itza was full of people. It was one of the most powerful cities of one of the most powerful ancient cultures \u2013 the Maya. But today, no one lives there. It is only a group of old buildings. However, people from around the world still come to see it. People come to learn about its ancient culture, the culture of the Maya people.The Mayan culture began almost 3,000 years ago. It grew in parts of Central America. Today we know this area as the countries of Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.The Maya were skilled in many areas. Experts believe the Maya were excellent farmers. They also believe that the Maya created a complex written language. This may have been the first written language to come from the Americas. The Maya were also very good at mathematics. Their number system included the number \u201czero.\u201d Mathematics experts say that using the number zero was an amazing thing. Other ancient cultures of the time did not use this number.However, people may know the Maya best for their calendar. A calendar separates time into different lengths, like months, days and minutes. Making a very exact calendar is extremely difficult. But the Maya used their knowledge of mathematics and their interest in the stars to build a calendar. They carefully d the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. This knowledge helped them to create their calendar.Other cultures also influenced and helped build parts of Chichen Itza. After a few hundred years, the Maya had left their city. They did return later. But then about 1,000 years ago a group called the Toltecs invaded the Maya. They did not conquer the Maya. Instead, the two cultures lived together. They even began to combine parts of their religious ceremonies. The Toltecs ruled the city for about 300 years. But they left the city. No one knows why.A little later, the Itza invaded the city.\u00a0 The Itza were invaders from a different area. The Itza built new parts of the city. And they gave the city its name. The name \u201cChichen Itza\u201d means \u201cmouth of the well of the Itza\u201d. However, the Itza did not rule the city very long. They left Chichen Itza after about 25 years. Again, no one knows why the Itza left.Experts know that the Toltecs and Itza built some of the buildings in the city of Chichen Itza. They used many images of their god in their building designs. The Toltecs and Itza worshipped the same god. Their god looked like a snake, but with feathers like a bird. In the beginning of this program we told you about a snake of light that climbs the wall of an ancient building. The snake of light is an image of this god.This interesting structure in Chichen Itza is the Pyramid of Kukulcan. A pyramid has four sides. These sides all come together at one point at the top. Each side on the Pyramid of Kukulcan has 91 steps. And there is one more step at the top of the pyramid. In all, there are 365 steps on the pyramid. This is the same as the number of days in a year. Some experts believe the Maya could have used this building to help them know when to plant crops. Each day the sun falls on a different step of the pyramid. This could be a way to follow the year.The people of Chichen Itza especially designed one building to observe and study the movement of the stars and planets. This building is the observatory. Experts say that the observatory is one of the most complex structures the Maya built. A set of steps went up and around and around the observatory tower. The steps made the observatory tower look like a large shell \u2013 like a snail\u2019s shell. The top of the observatory tower was a dome, that is, it was shaped like a half circle. And there were windows in the tower. Each window had a purpose. Experts believe that a person looking through one of these windows could see particular stars on particular dates. The Maya may have believed that studying the stars could tell them the future.But Chichen Itza was not only ancient buildings and studying stars. The citizens of Chichen Itza also had their own very popular ball games! Chichen Itza had the largest game area, or court, in Central America. The Maya probably played a game that was a little like football. Pictures of past games cover the walls of the ball court. But these pictures also show some violent events in these games. One picture even shows an official cutting off a man\u2019s head in the centre of the game court.Around the year 1300, the Itza people left the city. Experts do not know why they left. Some Maya people still lived there. In 1517 Spanish invaders tried to invade the area around Chichen Itza. The Maya resisted for a time. But they could not resist the Spanish for long. The Spanish finally defeated the Maya. Sadly, Spanish invaders later destroyed many historical documents. So, we may never know the full history of Chichen Itza.Today, people from all over the world visit the ancient ruins of Chichen Itza. The Secretary of Tourism in Mexico says that over a million tourists visit Chichen Itza every year. Large crowds gather at the Pyramid of Kukulcan to watch the snake of light climb. They see the carefully designed buildings. But today, the ruins will not be destroyed. Chichen Itza is a UNESCO World Heritage site, an important part of the world\u2019s history.The writer and producer of this program was Liz Waid. The voices you heard were from the United States.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A young woman sits at a table at home. She cuts some cotton cloth. Then she uses her sewing machine to make something special. It is something that will protect both her and other people. She is making a face mask to cover her mouth and nose.People around the world cover their mouths and noses for health reasons. Doctors wear face masks when they operate. Many people wear masks to protect them from poor air quality. But in 2020, many more people around the world started to wear masks. They did this to protect each other from the COVID-19 virus. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on wearing masks. We look at the long history of wearing masks for health reasons.Early records show that some individuals wore masks for health reasons hundreds of years ago. Leonardo da Vinci was a famous artist of the 15th century. He used paint that contained poisonous chemicals. He covered his face with a wet cloth to protect his lungs from those poisons.People also wore masks in the 17th century. At that time, a deadly sickness or plague came to Europe. People did not understand how disease was spread. But some doctors wore strange masks over their faces. The masks were shaped like the head of a bird. The long pointed beak contained herbs. These sweet-smelling plants were designed to protect the doctor from the smell of the disease and dead bodies.In the 19th century, doctors and scientists worked to understand how disease spread between people. They began to understand that the human breathing system could carry and spread germs and disease.Based on this new knowledge, scientists suggested something new to surgeons or doctors who operated on patients. They suggested surgeons should cover their nose and mouth with thin material called gauze. When a person breathes out, he can expel bacteria. But the gauze would stop this bacteria. It would protect any wound from being infected by it. By the 1920s, all surgeons wore masks to operate.By then, masks were also used as a treatment to prevent disease. In 1910, in Manchuria China a serious plague broke out. Wu Lien-teh from Malaya worked there. He developed a mask made from gauze and cotton that was tied behind the ears. These masks saved the lives of many doctors. The general population also used the masks to avoid getting the disease. A few years later this method of disease prevention had to be used again. That time, people in more than one country had to use it.In 1918, World War I ended. In that same year a terrible disease spread around the world. This global disease was a deadly flu virus. Over a period of two years, it infected almost one third of the world\u2019s population. Experts estimate that over 50 million people died from the virus. Many governments required everyone to wear masks on public transport and at work. Some people did not want to do this. In San Francisco USA, the government told people, \u2018Wear A Mask and Save Your Life.\u2019 Health experts said wearing a mask did not just protect them. It helped to protect others around them.In the middle of the 20th century, people started to wear masks for another health reason. In some countries, industry and high levels of traffic led to poor air quality. In many parts of Asia, people wear masks to protect them from polluted air. For example, in the Philippines and Vietnam, motorcycle riders wear masks in heavy traffic.In many countries in Asia people consider it normal to wear a mask when out in public. In 2017, Kei from Asian Boss spoke to young Japanese people about why they wear masks:\u2018It is considered good behaviour. You are not spreading your germs or bacteria around.\u2019\u2018I put it on because the air smells bad.\u2019Other Japanese people wear masks for reasons not connected with health. Some people use masks as a social barrier. One young man told Kei,\u2018I put my mask on because I feel people will not notice me so much. That makes me feel less worried.\u2019So many people in Asia wore masks that designers of clothes started to make masks to match clothes. Famous designers used international fashion events to show their masks. In 2015, Chinese designer Masha Ma included face masks covered with jewels at a fashion show.But in other parts of the world people did not normally wear masks. Some of the young people Kei spoke to were shocked to discover that people in the West did not wear a mask even if sick.In 2020, the attitude of people in the West changed. A deadly new virus called COVID-19, or coronavirus, spread around the world. The World Health Organisation advised people how to deal with coronavirus. This included information about the need to wear masks. If people could not keep a physical distance from each other they had to wear masks in public places. The organisation explained that masks can prevent someone else from being infected.People all over the world started to wear masks to protect each other. Some countries made it the law that people had to wear a mask in public. But not everyone owned a mask and sometimes masks were difficult to buy. Some governments told people to make their own masks.Spotlight\u2019s Liz Waid is one person who made masks. She lives in the USA where it was not common to wear a mask before coronavirus. As coronavirus spread around the world, Liz started to make masks. She made over 500 cloth masks for family, friends, and local schools and organisations. Every weekend, and many nights after work, she sat at home and sewed and made masks. Liz explains how she felt about making masks.\u2018I know that homemade masks are not a perfect solution to fighting coronavirus. But they can make a difference if everyone wears them. It makes me feel good to know that I am part of the solution. I am helping people in this simple way.\u2019Do you wear a face mask? Is wearing a mask common in your culture? Tell us about it.

I\u2019m Nick Page.And I\u2019m Christy VanArragon. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Imagine that you are sick. You go to see a doctor. Your doctor gives you some drugs. He tells you that they will make you better. You take the drugs and you do start to feel better. But later, the doctor tells you that it is not the drugs that have helped you. The drugs were just a sugar substance. The doctor explains that your improved health was from the placebo effect. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the placebo effect.\u201cPlacebo\u201d is a Latin word, used in English. It means, \u201cI shall please.\u201d The placebo effect is when a suggestion or belief that something is helpful actually makes it become helpful. For example, just the act of taking a medicine can improve a person\u2019s health! The mind works to heal the body.Scientists sometimes use placebos to test the effect of drugs, or medicines. They perform controlled experiments. They give one group of people the real medicine. They give another group of people a \u2018placebo\u2019 medicine. The placebo looks exactly like the medicine but it is not. It does not contain any healing elements. The people do not know which medicine they are taking \u2013 the real one or the placebo. The medicine has to produce better results than the placebo to prove that it is effective.However, sometimes the people taking the placebo experience improvements in their health. The false drug produces an effect \u2013 even though it is not supposed to! Scientists call this the \u2018placebo effect.\u2019Researchers have studied the placebo effect for many years. There is great interest about the subject. And there are still many unanswered questions. Why is a placebo effective? Mostly, researchers have looked at the placebo effect in terms of physical health. However, a research team in Sweden has produced some interesting findings about the emotional effects of placebos.The team performed a series of experiments. First the researchers showed a group of people unpleasant pictures, like images of dead bodies. The people rated how they felt after seeing the pictures. They gave the highest number to the pictures that gave them the worst feelings. The researchers then gave the people a calming drug. They told the people that the calming drug would reduce the unpleasant feelings from the pictures. When the team showed the pictures again, the people said that they felt much calmer.The following day, the researchers gave the people unpleasant images to look at again. Then, they gave them drugs. However, this time they gave them a placebo instead of the calming drug. The placebo was nothing but salt and water. But the people did not know this.After taking the placebo, the people\u2019s ratings still changed. Their unpleasant feelings reduced by almost 30%. It seems that taking the placebo made them feel calmer. During the experiment scientists also used special equipment to look at, or \u2018scan\u2019 the brain. They wanted to see if there was a change in the way the brains\u2019 emotional centres were behaving. The scans showed that the brains\u2019 emotional centres were more rested after the people took the placebo. The scientists claim that this is important new evidence. It means that placebos may reduce emotional pain. Dr Predrag Petrovic managed the experiment. He told the BBC:\u2018The placebo changes what we expect. When we expect that something unpleasant should become less unpleasant, it really does.\u2019So does that mean that doctors could use placebos to treat worry or anxiety? Dr. Petrovic said that this is not likely to happen. It would mean that doctors would have to lie to their patients. Dylan Evans teaches at a specialist university in England. He has written books about the placebo effect. He said:\u2018Doctors have a duty to care for their patients. But they also have a duty to tell the truth. Placebos seem to pull these two duties in opposite directions.\u2019The placebo effect may be real, but it cannot replace medicine. If a doctor lies to his patient it may have a bad effect on their relationship. And many researchers believe that a good relationship alone can help the healing process. Studies show that support and reassurance can improve health. A good patient-doctor relationship is healing. But this is nothing new. Hippocrates was a great physician, or doctor. He lived in ancient Greece. More than 2,000 years ago, he wrote:\u2019..the patient, though knowing that his condition is terrible, may recover his health simply through being satisfied with the goodness of the doctor.\u2019The mind can affect the body in good ways. But it can also produce bad effects. Some people describe the nocebo effect as \u2018placebo\u2019s evil brother.\u2019 Placebo means, \u2018I will please.\u2019 Nocebo means, \u2018I will harm.\u2019 A nocebo effect is when a suggestion or belief that something is harmful actually makes it become harmful. For example, some people feel nervous before a test. The nervous feeling gives them pains in their stomach \u2013 it can even produce physical sickness.Scientists and doctors are studying the relationship between the mind and the body very closely. It is important work. If doctors can understand how one influences the other, they may be able to help patients more effectively. Increasingly, people are looking at ways of treating the \u2018whole person\u2019- not just the body.Could it be that modern doctors have centred too much on treating the physical body? Developments in modern medicine are happening very quickly. For some people a trip to the doctor has become a quick fix. They have a pain in the head \u2013 so they take medicine. They treat the  \u2013 the physical pain. But are they in danger of never treating the causes?Bernard Palmer is a doctor and a Christian. He believes that people have physical, mental and spiritual needs. And he says that effective treatment recognises the needs of the \u2018whole person.\u2019 Many people have physical problems that are made worse by their mental state. And some people have deep spiritual needs \u2013 which only God can meet. Dr. Palmer says that God is concerned with our bodies, minds and spirits \u2013 and that we should be too. So maybe the placebo effect is not so surprising after all. It is simply meeting a need that is not physical. It seems that the human body is far more complex than we understand.The writers of this program were Marina Santee and Elizabeth Lickiss. The producer was Nick Mangeolles.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Megan Nollet. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.For thousands of years, powerful kingdoms and nations have extended their control over groups of people and territories. This is Colonialism. The indigenous people in many countries share a common story. Their people lived in the country \u2013 sometimes for thousands of years. They had their own culture and ways of life. Then another group of people came into their land. They took control of the land and its resources. This new group brought different ways of living. And often, the colonizing countries used force or unjust acts to extend their power over the aboriginal or indigenous people.Around the world, colonialism has caused much damage. It has also caused much mistrust between colonizing and indigenous people. Even generations later, the wounds are still deep. But is it possible to heal these wounds? Does the damage have to continue? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. This organization exists to help Canadians work toward a better future \u2013 even after the many hurts of colonialism.Today, Canada is a diverse country. It includes people from many different ethnic origins. However, the majority of the population has European ethnic origins. This was not always the case. Before the 1600s, indigenous tribes lived in Canada. These tribal people are now sometimes called first nations. During the 17th and 18th centuries, European powers colonized Canada. Many European immigrants moved to Canada. They quickly became the majority population. After a time, they formed a new nation called Canada. But this new nation did not fully include indigenous tribes.The Canadian government did not like the differences between the majority and indigenous cultures. They called it the \u201cIndian problem.\u201d So, in 1857, the government of Canada made a law called the Gradual Civilization Act. This law expressed a new policy. The government wanted to force indigenous people to end their own culture. The government wanted to force the indigenous people to become part of the majority culture. Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott was the head of Canada\u2019s Indian Affairs program from 1913 to 1932. He said,\u201cI want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think that the country should continue to protect a group of people who are able to stand alone. Our goal is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not become part of the larger culture.\u201dA major way that the government tried to end indigenous culture was through the residential school system. The government created this system of schools for indigenous children. Over a period of 100 years, 150,000 students attended the schools. The residential school system separated indigenous children from their families and communities. Many of the children lived at the schools for months at a time. The schools taught children that indigenous culture was evil. They could not speak their native languages. And they used only English names.The conditions at many of the schools were horrible. The schools were often too full and dirty. The schools did not have enough heating. And the students lacked medical care. Thousands of the children became sick and died. Some reports estimate that in some schools 30-60 percent of children died. Some of these children were buried at the schools in group burial sites. No one told their parents.Different Christian churches managed most of the residential schools. And at many of these schools religious leaders hurt the children. Leaders hit children and used extreme methods of punishment. Some priests sexually abused the children. They forced the children to perform sexual acts. Many, many children were emotionally and physically damaged in this way.The history of the residential school system became a story of shame for Canada. For many years, indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians wanted the government to admit it had been wrong. In 2006, the government of Canada made a legal agreement with indigenous tribes. The government agreed to give almost two billion dollars to individual people who survived the residential schools.But money alone could not solve the hurt of Canada\u2019s negative policies. There were too many victims and too much damage. So, the lawsuit also included a decision to create a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, or a TRC. A TRC is a kind of public court. The public can hear about crimes, address the harm, and look to the future. The Canadian TRC was established in 2008.The TRC held events in major cities all across Canada. At every event, the TRC educated people about what happened. People could walk through educational displays. These displays showed historical objects from the residential schools and indigenous culture. People could also attend classes on the history of the residential schools.One of the main parts of the TRC happened when people gathered together into listening circles. Non- indigenous and indigenous Canadians listened to the stories of people who experienced the residential school system. There were opportunities to ask and answer questions. These listening circles helped indigenous and non-indigenous people understand each other better.The TRC also provided places to discuss difficult questions. Questions like \u2018What kind of attitudes or thinking caused the residential school systems?\u2019 \u2018Do people still think this way today?\u2019 \u2018Do current laws support such attitudes?\u2019 These discussions could help indigenous and non-indigenous people work together to change Canada\u2019s current culture and laws.The TRC also created the chance for forgiveness and new beginnings. When the TRC was established, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper made an official apology to Canada\u2019s indigenous tribes. For the first time, the head of Canada accepted blame and expressed regret for what happened. During TRC events, government and community leaders also offered apologies and asked the indigenous communities for forgiveness. They also declared official promises to the tribes for the future.The TRC offices officially closed in 2015. They had collected stories from survivors. They produced reports and resources for students and teachers. And the work of the TRC continues in a new organization. It is called the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, or the NCTR. The NCTR says it is a place for learning. They promise to keep the truths of the residential schools safe and honored.And indeed, this issue continues even today. First nations people continue to find remains of children at the schools. In May and June of 2021 three more burial sites were found near residential schools. How can people move forward with a history like this? How can people continue the work of reconciliation?Don Klaassen is a Canadian who works for reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous people. His ancestors colonized farmland in British Columbia, Canada. In many ways, his life was built on government acts that were not fair to indigenous people.Klaassen began his reconciliation work by building a relationship with an indigenous man. This man was named Isadore Charters. Charters is a survivor of the residential schools. The two men became good friends. They worked together to create an educational class for the TRC. They also made a film about Charters\u2019 story. Klassen and Charters believe that the TRC provides a base for building new relationships. In their film, Charters says,\u201cWe have got to work together. Now that you know the story, you can help by passing the story on, by walking with us.\u201dIn a future Spotlight program we will look at the story of Isadore Charters. Listen and learn about how he found healing from his residential school experience.Have you ever heard of these residential schools? Has your country ever had to deal with a difficult situation?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Think about a food you HATED as a child. You never wanted to eat it because it tasted terrible! But, when you grew up, you tried that food again. This time, you LOVED it! What changed? Why did the food taste so good when you were older? The answer to this question may be . Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the amazing human tongue.The tongue is a muscle. It is like the muscles that move your arms or legs. However, the tongue is different in a big way. The tongue is not connected to any bones. It is a group of eight muscles that work together. This is what makes the tongue able to move and change shapes.The tongue\u2019s flexiblity and movement help with eating, drinking, talking and singing. But it is the surface of the tongue that helps with taste. The tongue has taste receptors located all across its top. Many people believe that the surface of the tongue has different areas to taste different things. This is not exactly true. Erich Voigt is a doctor at NYU Langone Medical Center. He told the website MentalFloss.com,\u201cTaste receptors are concentrated on the tip of your tongue \u2013 the front point. They are also along the sides and at the back. The middle of the tongue has the least taste ability. The idea that the tongue has different taste areas is a myth. There is no tongue map with different parts for different tastes. That idea is wrong. All taste areas are able to sense the five kinds of taste. These are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory.\u201dSo the tongue is a group of muscles that lets people taste different foods. But what is taste? And why do people taste things differently?For a long time, scientists thought there were four basic tastes. The first is salty. Salty foods are foods like french fries, soy sauce, olives, and chips. The next is sour foods. Sour foods are foods like lemons or yogurt. The third taste is sweet. Sweet foods are fruits, breads, and candy. The fourth taste is bitter. Bitter foods are foods like coffee, dark chocolate, and some spices.However, all people know that there are more than five tastes. And as science has advanced more tastes have been identified. Umami is the flavor of cooked meat. It is also sometimes called savory. Astringent foods make your mouth tighten. Pungent foods have a strong smell, such as mustard or ginger. These tastes were always part of foods. But people now use a new clearer way to talk about them.Every tongue is able to taste all of these things. However, every tongue tastes each kind of food at a different level. Some people may not like the taste of a sour lemon. Their tongue may be very sensitive to sour foods. So the sour lemon is too much taste for them to enjoy. Other people may love coffee. They may NOT be very sensitive to bitter foods. So the bitter taste of coffee is a perfect balance. What you like to eat is based on your tongue. You may never be able to make someone love a food that you love. If someone does not like the taste of fish, it will not matter how much they try it. Their tongue may not let them enjoy it.However, people should still try new foods often! The human tongue changes over time. As people get older, the tongue becomes less able to taste foods. This means that people could begin to like foods with more spice. Food they did not like as a child begins to taste great. Another reason for food tastes changing is that people also become less able to smell. Smell is a big part of eating. It influences how we react to foods.Each person\u2019s tongue combines genetics and culture. Your tongue tastes foods because of your parents\u2019 genes. You also have the food experiences you have because of the culture of your childhood. Veronique Greenwood wrote about why different cultures value different tasting foods for the BBC.com. She says that food tastes can make people remember home. She writes,\u2018The combination of tomato, garlic, oregano, and olive oil feels Italian. Food with dried shrimp, chili peppers, ginger, and palm oil feels Brazilian. For Germans, it is dill, sour cream, mustard, vinegar and black pepper. Chinese food uses soy sauce, rice wine, and ginger. Those tastes seem to describe a taste that most people from that culture enjoy eating.\u201dOne of the joys of travel is getting to try new foods. Each new place offers a new taste. But not every taste will be good to every person. Yet it is good to try new foods. Natalie Jesionka is a writer and teacher. She wrote about eating new foods for the Muse.com.\u201cNo matter how frightening a new food may seem, it is better to try it and experience it yourself. If it tastes great then you will have a new favorite food. If it tastes very bad? Well, then you will have a good travel story to share when you get home.\u201dDo you like to try new foods?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Babies need someone to do everything for them. They cannot feed themselves. They cannot clean themselves. They may even need help going to sleep. Studies show that the first year of life influences the rest of life. However, there are things that can help each child start in a happy and healthy way. You may have already heard our program called \u201c\u201d. But what happens after the baby is born? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on tips for how to help a child have a healthy first year of life.The first tip is to create a safe place for a new baby. Parents cannot keep their children safe at all times. Learning about the world will include small injuries. However, there are several things that will help lower the chance for injury.Babies are learning about the world. One way they do this is by putting things in their mouths. Parents should keep anything that could be dangerous away from the baby. This could be anything small, sharp, or poisonous. Some examples include cleaning chemicals, medicines, or small coins. Babies will eat anything.Babies learn to crawl around six to ten months. This new ability to move brings a new set of concerns. Parents need to protect children from serious injury. Falling down stairs is one common serious injury. Another common injury is burns. Babies can get burned from fires, stoves, or water that is boiling for cooking. Babies have not learned that fire is hot. Water is another possible source of danger. Parents should always watch a child in the bath or near a swimming pool.Another big danger is parents who are too tired. A baby requires a lot of work. Often, parents do not sleep very much. They can become angry when the baby cries for no reason. But parents should never shake or hit a baby. Shaking a baby can cause brain damage, serious injury, or even death. When parents feel this way, they should go to another room for a short time. They should ask for help from another adult. Raising a baby is difficult work.The second tip for making sure a child has a healthy first year is to give them enough food and enough sleep. A helpful pattern for babies is eat, activity, sleep. Stephanie Parker owns a company that sells sleeping clothes for babies. She thought about this pattern a lot when her own child was not sleeping. She explained this pattern on babysleepsite.com. She says it begins with eating.\u201cIt is important that your baby get a full feeding. This will make it easier for them to know the pattern. It is tempting to feed your baby to sleep. But I would encourage parents to keep their baby awake after feeding them. By doing this, the baby will learn to fall asleep on their own. They will not need the breast or the bottle.When your baby is done eating, play with her and give her some exercise. This will encourage better sleep. When the baby starts to get tired, that is when you put them down to sleep. If you wait too long the baby can become too tired. Then it will be difficult for them to sleep. If your baby is waking up after only 30 or 45 minutes, or earlier, help them learn that it is not time to be awake yet.\u201dThe third tip for a baby to have a healthy first year of life is to take them to a doctor. There are two reasons to take a baby to the doctor. The first is that babies need immunizations, or vaccines. These important medicines protect babies from serious sicknesses, such as hepatitis, tetanus, measles, and more. Even though the child is not sick, these medicines are safe and helpful.The second reason babies should see doctors is that a doctor will make sure that the baby is growing at a healthy rate. A good doctor will notice things that may be signs of medical problems.It can be helpful for parents to write down any special event in a book or journal. These could be things like when the baby rolled over, slept all through the night, or said her first word. This can be helpful in a meeting with a doctor. It is also a way to create a book of memories for the child when they grow up.The final tip to help a child have a healthy first year is to learn to understand them. Babies make many different noises. These noises may seem meaningless. But when parents pay attention, they start to understand the different noises. For example, one cry may be for hunger. Another cry may be for pain.And just because a baby does not understand your words, it does not mean they do not understand you. Babies need a lot of time and attention. Parents can use soft words. They can touch the baby\u2019s skin and face. They can look into the baby\u2019s eyes. All these things create connection and show love. This is not always easy. But it is very important. Darcia F. Narvaez is a professor of Psychology at the University of Notre Dame. She wrote about bonding with babies for the website Psychology Today. She writes,\u201cYou need to be there. This means emotionally. Do not be doing other things. Do not be on the phone or computer. Do not even be thinking of other things. Pay attention to when the baby wants you and then talk, sing, dance, play with them. Take a break when you need it by passing the baby to another adult. Or put the baby on your back and do your work. Or bring the baby outside to see the natural world\u201dWhat about you? What else do you think is important for a healthy first year of life? Did you follow any of these tips for your children? Will you follow them if you have children later? Tell us what you think. You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at contact@spotlightenglish.com.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Here is tonight\u2019s top story: something is happening to young people around the world. We have reports of young people acting strangely. Young people are changing very quickly. They sleep all the time. They eat large amounts of food. They smell very bad. They are only able to communicate with their friends and not with their parents. If you see a young person, use extreme care. They may become angry for no reason. What is causing these changes? Is there any hope for these young people?You may wish you had heard a news story like this before you knew a teenager. You may be happy to learn that there are answers for some of these questions! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life during the teenage years.Young people go through a lot of changes. These changes are called puberty. Puberty is the process of a body changing from a child into an adult. It can begin as early as age nine in girls. It usually begins later in boys. In boys, puberty usually begins around age 12.The bodies of young people change a lot. Their bodies can grow many centimeters in just a few years. Young people grow taller and more muscular. Girls develop breasts and their bodies become able to have babies. Boys\u2019 voices become lower and their bodies become ready to make a baby with a woman.Young people also experience a lot of changes outside their bodies. Their relationships change. Young people depend less on their parents. They may become busy with school. Michelle Zehr is a writer for the website Livestrong.com. She wrote about the pressure on young people.\u201cYour teenage years come with a lot of pressures. These include the pressures to fit in and do well in school. There is school, sports, special interests and even a part-time job. It can be difficult to find the time to lead a healthy life. But as a young person it is important to remember that the healthy things you do now will help you through the rest of your life.\u201dYoung people can do several things to have a healthy life. The first thing a young person can do is to get enough sleep. Experts say that young people need between nine and nine and a half hours of sleep every night. This is because young people are growing and changing so fast. And sleep can help with these changes.The second thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to wash and care for skin and body. Charles Wibbelsman is a doctor for children and a writer. He wrote for the website WebMD.\u201cParents too often think that children will somehow just learn what they need to know about cleaning their body. But that is not true. Someone has to teach them.\u201dSomeone needs to teach children about washing their body, skin, and hair. This includes changing clothes regularly, cleaning teeth, and know when their feet smell bad. Young people will not find these things difficult. But they must remember this new responsibility.The third thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to eat and drink good foods. During these years, young people eat a lot of food. But they do not always eat good, healthy food. Sometimes young people eat too much food that is fast and easy to eat, such as sweets, pizza, or boxed foods. They do not eat enough fresh food like fruits and vegetables.The fourth thing a young person can do to live a healthy life is to avoid risky behaviour. Parents give advice to young people. But young people like to test limits. They may smoke or try drugs and alcohol. They may chew betel-nut or tobacco. These things can become addictive. Once a person begins using them, it can be difficult to stop. They are harmful to the body.Young people feel a lot of pressure to do these things. Young people want to be like their friends. If their friends drink alcohol, they will want to drink alcohol too. Young people may feel less worried about what other people think of them if they use drugs or alcohol. Drugs and alcohol can make a person feel good for a short time. But these things can hurt your body in ways that will only appear years later.The other common risky behaviour is sex. Young people start to be interested in sex. Sex is an important part of life. But it does have different risks when people are not married. Zehr writes,\u201cIf you have decided to have sex as a teenager, be smart about your health. To avoid pregnancy and getting a sexually transmitted disease, use protection in the form of condoms, birth control pills, or other methods. Remember that not all birth control methods protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Talk to your doctor about the birth control methods that are right for you. When you become sexually active, make a yearly trip to your doctor.\u201dThe final thing is for parents. Parents need to love and support their children through these changes. Parents experience changes too. They need to begin giving their children more responsibility and choice. Parents can tell their children that these changes are a normal part of life. The website Better Health channel is made by the government of the Australian state of Victoria. It advises parents:\u201cYou may need to accept that you will not have total control over your child\u2019s choices and life direction. It may help to trust that you have done your best as a parent. But if your child makes new friendships that lead to acts that concern you, such as violence or drug taking, you may feel stress. In these times it may be useful to seek help from a family counsellor or other service which offers parenting help or classes. Let your child know you are there for them, no matter how old they are.\u201dWhat do you think makes the teenage years better? What is the best advice you can give a teenager? Tell us what you think.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is very difficult to live your best life if you are not healthy. Today\u2019s Spotlight program is part of a series of programs about living a healthy life. The first Spotlight program was on having a healthy pregnancy. The second Spotlight program was on a healthy first year of life. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on three things people can do to help children to have a healthy childhood.Being a parent takes a lot of work. But there are ways to help you raise a healthy and happy child. These three things are taking care of the physical body, caring for the mind, and having healthy relationships with other people.The first way to have a healthy childhood is to take care of the physical body. If a child lives in a dangerous situation, they cannot have a healthy life. Parents cannot stop all hurt and harm. Children often get hurt playing hard or falling down. This is one of the ways children learn about what is safe and what is not. But parents should work to keep children as safe as possible. Parents need to be careful around water, especially with young children. Other concerns are fire, guns, and knives. Children like to explore. But they should not explore things that could lead to injury or death.Parents should also take children for regular medical tests. Doctors examine if children are growing. Doctors also give vaccines. Vaccines are medicines given to children before they get sick. They are tested and safe. Sometimes vaccines can seem frightening. However, according to the United States Center for Disease Control website:\u201cVaccines during childhood are very important. That is because they help protect children before they are exposed to life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to make sure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the right ages.\u201dThe last part of caring for a child\u2019s physical body is making sure the child is eating good food and getting enough exercise. A report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, says:\u201cChildren ages three through five should be encouraged to move and be active. They should do things such as throwing games and bicycle or tricycle riding. To strengthen bones, young children should hop, skip, jump, and roll around. A target may be three hours each day. This can be all kinds of exercises: light, moderate, or fast. Children ages six through 17 years can achieve most health benefits by doing moderate and fast physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes or more each day.\u201dRemember that most children learn by watching what adults do. If adults are eating good food and exercising, children will also want to do these things. And if adults around them smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol, children may do that. If adults spend hours looking at a phone, then children will want to do that too. Parents need to teach with their words. But they also need to show children with their actions.Physical bodies are important. But adults must also take care of children\u2019s minds. Children are learning all the time. And they start learning even before they are in school. Even babies learn to see faces, shapes, and different colors. Young children learn about what things feel like, what different foods taste like, and how to move and walk.When children are old enough, they should attend school. It is not enough that some children get an education. A good education is important for  boys and girls. And education is important for the future of the whole world. Jessie Woolley-Wilson is the CEO of Dreambox. Dreambox is an online mathematics teaching program. She wrote for Fast Company magazine.\u201cOur shared future depends on every child receiving a quality education. They will need to be ready to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges. It does not matter their sex, race, or where they live.\u201dThe third thing people can do to create a healthy childhood is to take care of a child\u2019s heart. That is, children need good relationships with other people. It is also important that a child feels emotionally connected to a community of people. Jason Williams is the Director of Quality and Safety at the Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. He wrote about connecting with children on the hospital\u2019s website:\u201cAnything can connect with children. You can go on a bike ride, walk the dog, talk in the car, or let them help you shop. Any time you spend around your children can be a chance for connection. It does not have to be complex. With a baby, it could be as simple as 30 seconds of play or touching her toes. With older kids, it can just be taking time to stop and look at something your child is interested in. You can comment on it and see the world through her eyes. It could be playing a game \u2014 even a video game. Or it could be having a teenager show you what he is posting on Instagram. The important thing is to get on their level, be in their world.\u201dLife is not easy for parents or children. Some parents cannot create a healthy space for their children, even if they want to. They do not have enough money or experience. They may not be able to get good medical care. They may not be able to send their child to the best school. Yet all parents can offer love and connection to their children. And love and connection are two of the most important things people can give to children.What else do you think helps a child live a healthy life? What stops a person from living a healthy life?

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.One morning Mary felt strange. She did not feel sick, but she did feel different. She and her husband had been trying to have a baby. Mary wondered if she could be pregnant. So, she took a pregnancy test. She was pregnant! Mary and her husband were going to have a baby. They were filled with excitement and joy. But soon, they felt something else \u2014 worry. Mary worried that she did not know what she should do to have a healthy pregnancy. A healthy pregnancy would help her baby to be healthy.This is a made-up story. But these are common worries for many pregnant women and their partners. Pregnancy can have risks. But there are also things people can do to have a healthy pregnancy. These things cannot make sure the baby is healthy. But they can give the baby and mother a better chance at health. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on simple tips for a healthy pregnancy.There is a lot of advice for pregnant women. Some of this advice is cultural. Different cultures offer different advice for pregnant women. Or it seems like there is too much advice. A pregnant woman may feel like it is all too much to do! But these tips are general. They are simple ways that pregnant women can be a little healthier.The first tip for pregnant mothers is to eat good foods. A baby still living inside a mother\u2019s body is called a fetus. The fetus gets all it needs from what a mother eats. For a baby to be healthy, it needs healthy foods as a fetus. Pregnant women should eat vegetables and fruits. They should eat whole grains like oats and rice. Protein is also important. It is found in foods like eggs, beans, nuts, and meats. It is also good to eat some cheese or yogurt.However, there are some foods pregnant women should avoid. Many health experts say that pregnant women should not eat unwashed foods, soft cheeses, or meat that is not cooked. These foods can contain harmful bacteria. This bacteria can cause the woman to lose important nutrients in her body. It can even cause the woman\u2019s body to reject the fetus. Some experts also say that pregnant women should limit their caffeine. This is the drug found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks. Too much caffeine can result in the baby having unhealthy low birth-weight.But the two things that women should ALWAYS avoid during pregnancy are smoking and alcohol. Smoking can result in early birth before the baby is ready. It can also cause the fetus not to grow properly. And pregnant women should avoid all alcohol. The Center for Disease Control in the United States writes on their website about alcohol and pregnancy. They say:\u201cThere is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time during pregnancy to drink. All kinds of alcohol are equally harmful. This includes wine and beer. Alcohol in the mother\u2019s blood goes into the baby. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, death, and several physical, behavioral, and mental problems.\u201dOne thing a woman should drink while pregnant is clean water. Water is a good drink for all people. Water improves blood flow, skin health, and digestion. If a woman does not drink enough water during pregnancy, she may not produce enough breast milk. She may get a headache or feel more tired.Another tip for a healthy pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin. These vitamins are designed to help pregnant women. Sometimes it is difficult for a woman to get all she needs through food. But a good prenatal vitamin will include iron for the blood, calcium for bones, folic acid for the health of the baby, and many other things.The next tip for a healthy pregnancy is to sleep a lot. It can be difficult to sleep during pregnancy. As the fetus grows inside the mother, it pushes her internal organs around. Woman can suffer from back pain and difficulty breathing. But sleep can help everyone. When people sleep enough, they reduce stress, build muscle, repair body tissues, and process things they have learned that day.A pregnant woman may have to try new things to be able to sleep. The best position for her to sleep in is on her side. Sleeping on her back or stomach can cause problems. A woman can use pillows or other soft things to get into a comfortable position. If possible, a woman\u2019s partner should encourage her to sleep longer. He could take on a few more morning duties for her. Or he could encourage her to sleep during the day.But even if a pregnant woman is sleeping more, she still needs to stay active and exercise if she can! This is the sixth tip for a healthy pregnancy. Exercise is good for most people. This is true for pregnant woman as well. It is important that women talk to their doctor before beginning any exercise program. Staying physically strong during the pregnancy can also help with the birth and recovery.The final tip for a healthy pregnancy is to think about a plan for the birth of the baby. Labor is usually painful and can be frightening. Thinking about what the birth might be like can give a woman some control over what is happening. She can make a plan for how she would like things to go or about who she would like to be there.People cannot always control if there is a healthy birth or not. But there are things that women can do to have the most healthy pregnancy possible. And there are things their partners can do to encourage them in this work. A healthy pregnancy sets up a healthy baby. And a healthy baby can mean a healthy life.Will you have to change anything if you become pregnant? Did you follow any of these tips if you were pregnant?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.When Betty Apio married her husband many years ago, both their families were full of hope and happiness. Apio lives in the country of Uganda. In Uganda, as in many countries, everyone expects women to have children. Many people there believe that women exist to have children. To fail at this, is to fail as a wife and as a woman.After Apio was married, her husband prepared their house for children. Then they waited. They tried again and again to have children. But the children never came.Today\u2019s Spotlight is on infertility. Some people are not able to have children \u2014 even when they are trying for over a year. This is infertility. There are many medical reasons for infertility. But today\u2019s Spotlight is on the social attitudes surrounding infertility.Betty Apio and her husband went to a doctor to find out what was wrong. She received some medical treatments from the doctor. But they did not work. To make the situation worse, her husband\u2019s family began to make fun of her and call her bad names. In Uganda, a man can have more than one wife. So, his family told him to find another woman, a second wife. This new wife gave him two children. Now Apio lives a different kind of life. She told the Washington Post Foreign Service:\u201cPeople will never give me respect. They believe I have no value. They insult me. They say: \u2018You barren woman, you are useless!\u2019 It is horrible. I must be strong or I will not survive.\u201dInfertility affects people all around the world. It does not matter if you have money, education, or power. And it affects both men and women. Experts say that globally, about 15 percent of all couples who are at the age to have children are infertile. In some places, this number can be as high as 20 percent.Infertility is common. But people do not often talk about this problem. Many people feel great pressure to have children, even if they are successful in other areas of life. To men and women who want to have children but are not able, the pressure can be crushing. And often, if a couple cannot have children, people blame the woman.This can lead women especially to feel shame. They believe that they are alone in their struggle with infertility. They may even avoid talking about children. They may avoid attending events where children will be present. They may even find it difficult to be happy when children are born to other people.It is difficult to be infertile. But the social attitude about infertility only makes the problem worse. As in Betty Apio\u2019s case, the community can make infertile people feel great shame. But people should not feel shame about their infertility. They should not feel alone. In fact, some women are speaking out to encourage other people who may be struggling. By talking together, they are finding hope.Betty Apio wanted to be one of these women. She decided to talk about her situation. She wanted to share her story with other women. She did not want other people to feel like she did.Apio has found some help at a support center in Kampala. At the center there were groups that help women. These groups explain the medical reasons for infertility. Women can connect with other women. And they can connect with doctors who can help them at a fertility center.Prakesh Patel runs one of the fertility centres in Kampala. He told the Washington Post that many women struggle to visit him. Women often do not want anyone to know they are going to a fertility centre. And they share great sadness. He said,\u201cI say to them, \u2018This is not a disease. There are many like you. You do not have to feel shame.\u201dIf you or someone you know is infertile, the best thing you can do is to find people who support you. Surround yourself with people who will love you and care for you. These people may be in your own family, but they may not. They may be some friends or people from your community.If you do not feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, there may be resources in your community. Many fertility centers have support groups. They are a good place to learn about what medical treatments are possible in your area. These treatments are not possible for everyone. They may cost a lot of money. And they do not always work. But the most important treatment is the support and love to face the challenge of infertility.The emotional pain of infertility is very real. This is true even for people who are able to build their family in other ways such as through medicine or through adoption, caring for a child without parents.Many people who are infertile feel anger and shame. They may wonder why this could happen to them. They may  to feel peace and acceptance. But they also may not want to lose the dream of having children.Shannon Woodward wrote a book about her struggle to make peace with her infertility called \u201cInconceivable\u201d. It was not easy for her. Her desire to have her own children never went away. Woodward is a Christian. She says she was able to see how God can work through her pain. She writes:\u201cFor years, I hated my broken body parts. I took my worth from what I could or could not produce. I asked God to heal my body. But it turns out he had a better plan. He healed parts of me I did not know were broken. He put new skin on old wounds. He freed me from my pain and self-hatred.\u201dInfertility is painful. But facing infertility can bring healing. If you are infertile, look for support. And if you know an infertile person, offer them love and support.Do you know someone who has struggled to have a baby?

I\u2019m Katy Blake.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Susan Saunders was just a young mother. But her own mother began to suffer from dementia.  is not a disease. It is a general loss of skills such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. A person with dementia cannot do normal things on their own. This can happen for several medical reasons. Saunders knew that she did not want her own daughters to have to watch her getting old this way. She began to research how to stay healthy while growing old. She told the news website The Guardian,\u201cI decided to do everything I could to increase my chances of aging well.\u201dSome people say that . But everyone grows old. As people age, their bodies and minds change. They are not able to move as fast or be as strong as they once were. Sometimes people get diseases that they cannot prevent. However, there are things people can do to get the best chance of living a long and healthy life. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on tips for living a healthy life as you grow old.In many ways, what people need in their lives is always the same. People need to eat good food. They need to avoid smoking and other harmful things. However, older people may need to do a little more. They need to be more careful because they may not recover quickly if something goes wrong.The first tip to living well is to drink enough water.\u00a0 There are three reasons why drinking water is important as people age. First, as people grow older their bodies begin to contain less water. Second, the kidneys stop working as well. These organs clean the body\u2019s water. And third, research shows that older people do not feel thirsty as soon as younger people.Under good conditions this is usually not a big problem. But if there is a medical problem that leads to blood loss, or even a very hot day, older people can become dehydrated and sick. In fact, in France during the summer of 2003 over 14,000 people died because of causes related to not drinking enough water. Most of these people were old people.The second tip for healthy living is to spend time outside. Scientists are discovering that being outside has many health benefits. Fresh air and sunshine improve lungs and skin. It can also reduce stress. But as people grow old, they may not be able to walk as well. People can struggle to get outside, especially if there is snow or ice. Older people can sometimes spend weeks or months without going outside. But research shows that even 30 minutes outside can make a big difference to a person\u2019s health and attitude.The third tip to living a healthy life as you get older is to think about the past in a healthy way. The average length of life is different depending on where in the world you live. But all aging people understand that they have less time left to live. This can make them ask a lot of questions. Erik Erikson was a famous psychologist. He developed a series of steps of human life. Kendra Cherry wrote about Erikson\u2019s work for the website VeryWellMind.com. She writes:\u201cSuccess at this older time of life means that people are able to look back at their life with a sense of happiness. They can face the end of life with a sense of wisdom and no regrets. Erikson defined this wisdom as an \u201cinformed and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself.\u201d Those who feel proud of their achievements will feel a sense of wholeness. These individuals will get wisdom, even when looking at death. Those who are not successful during this time of life will feel that their life has been wasted. They will experience many regrets. This person will be left with feelings of bitterness and no hope.\u201dThe fourth tip to living a healthy life in old age is to give to your community. A person can give money. But adding to your community is so much more than money. Throughout life, a person learns a lot of different skills. Some skills are learned at work. But some skills are learned through hobbies or other life experiences. A person can use the skills he has learned to improve the community around him. A person can discover meaning and purpose to life when they find a way to add to their community. It is also a good way to help those people that they care about.The last tip for living a healthy life as we age is to keep learning. Erika Andersen is a writer for Forbes. She says in many places of the world people are living longer. But they are not always living better. She thinks one solution is to stay connected to the world through learning. This could be reading about something you do not know much about. It could be trying a new food \u2013 or even meeting a new person. Andersen writes:\u201cOne of the best ways to stay active as you get older is to always choose to learn new things. The least interesting older people I know are those who find a comfortable place and stop. They do the same things. They have the same conversations. They express the same opinions. Choose to learn something totally new every week or every month. There is nothing like being bad at something to wake you up and shake you out of your understanding. And when you start to get good at it, it can make you feel as excited as a six-year-old.\u201dWhat about you? How will you stay healthy as you grow older?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Once upon a time, there was a very strong woodcutter. A king hired him to cut down trees. The pay was good. And the work conditions were good too. The woodcutter wanted to do his best. The king gave him a sharp axe to cut the trees. He showed the woodcutter the area where he would work.The first day, the woodcutter cut 18 trees. The king was pleased. The woodcutter was encouraged. So, he tried harder the next day. But he could only cut 15 trees. Each day he cut fewer and fewer trees. The woodcutter wondered if he was becoming weak.He told the king that he did not understand what was happening. The King asked, \u201cWhen was the last time you sharpened your axe?\u201d The woodcutter replied, \u201cSharpen my axe? I had no time for that! I have been too busy cutting trees!\u201dMayo Oshin wrote this story for the website Thrive Global. The point of the story is that sometimes people work more and more. But they forget what is important. With a small fix, they could be working smarter. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on managing time to do more.Everyone has things they need to do. These things can be school, work, or things at home. People may need to care for children, fix a broken window, or sit through a meeting at work. These are all important things. They all take time and attention. But everyone also has things they  to do. These could include finishing school, writing a book, or learning a new language. These things help us change, improve, or add to the world. So how do you balance the things you  to do with the things you  to do?You can learn to use your time in better ways. Maybe like the woodcutter in the beginning of this program, you just need to sharpen your axe! You may need to just work in a smarter way. Here are six tools of time management you can use.The first tool of time management is to remember the big picture. Instead of thinking about all the things you have to do, think about where you want to be in one year. Write it on a piece of paper. Put it where you will see it every day. It could be in your kitchen or bathroom. You could make it into the wallpaper on your phone. This will remind you of your bigger goals.The second tool of managing your time well is to plan out your week. When you plan out a week, you can make sure that you are spending time on things that are important. Plan out everything! Plan time for work, but also plan time for learning, exercise, rest, and time with family and friends. You may think this means you cannot have any fun. But a good plan can create freedom. Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky wrote a book called \u201cMake Time\u201d. In it, they write,\u201cWhen you do not have a plan, you have to always decide what to do next. You can use a lot of time thinking about all the things you should or could do. But a completely planned day provides the freedom to concentrate on the moment. You do not have to think about what to do next. You can trust the plan set out by your past self.\u201dA good plan is a good start. But this is only the beginning. The third way to manage your time is to avoid distractions and interruptions. Distractions and interruptions stop us from concentrating on something. When we are distracted, we lose the progress on that important work. Deep Patel wrote about distractions for the website Entrepreneur.com\u201cEven with the best of effort, we still look at social media when we should be working on a project. We touch our cell phone when we hear a noise. If we are not checking our email every five minutes, we worry we may miss something important. Statistics show that distractions cause a huge loss in productivity. Employees spend 28 percent of their time dealing with interruptions and then trying to get back to work.\u201dDistractions and interruptions are everywhere. But the fourth way to manage time is to  distractions. You cannot avoid all distractions \u2013 that is impossible! But you can try to have fewer distractions in your day. Turn off your phone. Turn the internet off on your computer. If possible, go somewhere that is not your office. Even if you only focus for an hour, you can get a lot done. There is very little in life or work that cannot wait one hour.The fifth way to manage your time is to do your most important thing at the beginning of the day. Oshin explains,\u201cAs a rule, plan your most important and creative work in the early hours of waking up. This is when you have the most energy. On the other side, you could plan your low creative work, such as email, social media, or phone calls later in the day. This is when your energy is lowest.\u201dThe sixth, and final way to manage your time is to know when to stop working. Many people take their work home. They even bring their phones into bed with them. People are always connected to each other and their work. In a survey from Forbes, 82 percent of people say they stay connected to the office even when they go home. The same survey said 50 percent are still connected when they go to bed.Managing time can help us get more work done. But it can also help us do more of the things we want. Following these tips can help you do both. Then you can follow one common English saying: Work smarter, not harder.How do you plan your week? Do you use an app? Do you write a list of things to do?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is the year 1803. A four-year old boy is on a boat. He is doing an important job. He is helping to bring a virus from Spain to Central America. There the virus will protect people from an even worse disease. This is one of the first times a vaccine will be traveling across an ocean. And this boy is carrying the vaccine in his own body.In the past, vaccines were transported like this. Today, we have better technology. But health experts still struggle to send important vaccines to the farthest places on earth. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the ways people transport vaccines around the world.Vaccines are . They protect people against deadly diseases. The first vaccine was for the terrible disease smallpox. In some parts of the world, half of the people who got sick with smallpox died. But doctors in Europe had . They infected people with a similar virus called cowpox. Cowpox did not make people as sick. When they got better from cowpox, their bodies knew how to protect them from getting the smallpox virus too.In the 1800s, doctors took fluid from the cowpox on one person. Then they injected the fluid into another person. Soon whole villages of people in Europe were safe from smallpox.But across the ocean many people were still dying from smallpox. Doctors wanted to bring the cowpox virus to these places. They needed a way to transport the cowpox virus a very far distance. So Spanish doctors took 22 young boys on a long trip to Central America. These boys were orphans who had no parents. They were between three and 10 years old.Before the trip began, doctors infected two of the boys with cowpox. Every 10 days of the trip, doctors took fluid from the infected boys\u2019 cowpox. Then they infected the next two boys. By the time the boys reached Central America, only one of them had a spot of cowpox left on his body. But that was enough!People celebrated the boys for bringing cowpox to protect them. Happy crowds cheered with bells. The boys were placed with new families. They were promised a good education. Because of these boys, as many as 12,000 people were protected from smallpox in just two months in this area. From there, the vaccine could spread into the wider Americas.But today we wonder about these boys. Did they want to help in this way? Did they get to decide? Probably not. Some were too young to even understand what was happening to them. But because of these boys, many lives were saved.Authorities can transport vaccines in much better ways today. Scientists and doctors have learned a lot since the 1800s. But again, we must send a very important vaccine all around the world. Today, people in every country need the COVID-19 vaccine. How will we transport vaccines for COVID-19 to parts of the world that are hard to reach?Transporting the COVID-19 vaccines is challenging. The vaccines must be kept very cold. There are parts of West and Central Africa where people do not always have electricity. UNICEF is working to set up new refrigerators there. Solar power from the sun will help to keep these refrigerators cold. Jean-Cedric Meeus works for UNICEF. He says:\u201cWest and Central Africa is one of the most complex places you will find. We are transporting COVID-19 vaccines to major cities. But we must also deliver them to very remote villages. We found that there was not enough cold storage. Then we set about building almost 20,000 solar-powered refrigerators \u2014 all the way from the coast to the forests.\u201dRobin Nandy also works for UNICEF. He explains that they will use many forms of transportation to get the vaccines where they need to go. COVID vaccines will travel by boat to small islands and to villages along the Amazon River. Snowmobiles will have to transport vaccines in winter conditions to parts of Alaska that are very far away. Nandy imagines vaccines will travel by motorcycle, drone, elephant, horse, and even camel. He explains:\u201cThis has never happened before. We are trying to send a new vaccine to every country in the world in the same year.\u201dSome far away island countries have no reported cases of COVID yet. But it is still important to get the vaccine to the people there. These communities may have fewer medical resources. If someone there gets COVID-19, the disease could spread very quickly.Authorities may even start using  to transport vaccines to hard-to-reach parts of the world. These small machines can be controlled from a far distance. Drones can reach places like rural India. Moz Siddiqui works for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. He explained to the Thomas Reuters Foundation:\u201cEvery single COVID-19 vaccine is so important. That is why it is necessary to make sure that countries have the support and tools to transport vaccines quickly and well to those who need them. Drones help us by adding another kind of transportation. They are a special solution to a problem faced by many countries.\u201dTransporting vaccines has often been difficult. Little boys once sailed across the ocean. Today drones fly with no pilot at all. People have always needed to be creative to send vaccines across long distances. And they will need to continue to be creative today.By early August 2021, almost 15 percent of the world\u2019s population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. And health experts were giving over 38 million doses of the vaccine each day. But there is still a lot of work to do to get these vaccines everywhere they need to go.Is a COVID-19 vaccine easy to get where you live? Are organizations doing enough to get it to you?

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Have you ever seen a person try to stand up and then make this sound? Did it make you think they were old? Did it make you wonder what happened to them? As we grow, our bodies become less able to move. We must slow down when we move or exercise or play sport. We must be careful. If we are not careful, we can hurt our neck, our knees, or our back. When this happens, it can take weeks or even months to feel better. And even simple things, like sitting down, become a problem. This does not only happen to much older people. It starts happening as we enter adulthood.This program is part of a series of programs called . Other programs focused on , the , , and . Today\u2019s Spotlight is on how to live a healthy adult life and recover from injury.Before we begin, we should note that all information in this program is not meant to replace going to a doctor. If you have a serious injury or sickness, you should go to a doctor for help.The human body is an amazing thing. It can fix itself. This is a miracle that most people do not think about. Julie K. Silver is a doctor who specializes in helping people recover after serious sickness or injury. She is amazed at how the human body works to repair itself after an injury. She wrote for AARP.com:\u201cYour body works hard to help you recover. Even if you do little to help the process along. There is a lot happening in your body, both day and night, to help you to heal. When you are injured, white blood cells go to the injury to stop things getting worse. Other blood cells remove dead cells and help to control inflammation. If you , bone cells build the rough edges back together. There are so many cells assisting us in healing that we could never count them all. These processes happen on their own. But there are things smart patients can do to speed and strengthen their recovery.\u201dSo what are these things that can help people heal faster and better? The first and best thing you can do is to . Everyone knows that a good night of sleep makes you feel great. But scientists in many different fields of study believe sleep helps in growth, recovery, and mental health. Most healthy people are not getting enough sleep. And Dr. Silver says that people recovering from an injury need even more. She says,\u201cIf you are like most people, you need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. During sickness you may need more rest than that. Your body\u2019s healing processes require sleep to work. For example, your body produces the chemical melatonin when you sleep. This chemical increases your immune system and helps repair your body. It may even help prevent some forms of cancer. But if you are not sleeping enough at night, your melatonin levels can be reduced.\u201dThe next tip for recovering after injury is to continue to move in healthy ways. Do not make the injury worse. Many athletes continue to exercise and play sport when they are injured. They do not know the difference between pain from effort and pain from injury. In these cases, they may need total rest. But many experts say that light activity can help people heal faster. In fact, a study from 2005 showed that wounds healed faster when people moved.Researchers from Ohio State University in Columbus studied a group of older adults from ages 55 to 77. All the adults were healthy. During the study, about half of the adults exercised three times a week for three months. The other half did not exercise during this time. Each person in the study also received a small but deep wound on the upper part of their arm. Researchers took pictures of the wound over time as it healed. And the adults recorded their exercise. At the end of the study, researchers discovered something amazing. The wounds of the people who exercised healed about ten days faster than the wounds of the people who did not exercise.The next tip to recover after an injury is to eat good food and drink enough water. Food is the first medicine. What we put in our bodies becomes our bodies. Foods like fish, eggs, and yogurt can help with broken bones. Meat, nuts, and seeds can help our blood. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C. Vitamin C helps people stay healthy and heal from cuts on the skin. Eating good food is important for all people. And it is very important when recovering from a sickness or injury.The final tip to help recover after an injury is to work on the mental parts of recovery. An injury often requires us to change the way we live. This can be frustrating. We want to be able to live at the same fast speed that we always did. But an injury can make us slow down. Carrie Cheadle is a professor of sports psychology at John F. Kennedy University. She told Outside Magazine how people cannot deny what it will take to recover. She says:\u201cYou should not ignore the frustration and sadness that come with injury. But you should look at all the good things in your life. Let yourself have some joy. It makes you understand that everything is not horrible. It is often as simple as focusing on something that makes you happy that is not exercise or sport. You may even try keeping a journal and writing down three things you are thankful for every night. This can help move your thoughts away from your injury.\u201dHave you ever had an injury?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Seventeen hundred years ago, in the city of Rome, a man was put in prison. He was a Christian believer. And he had not obeyed the Emperor. He was sentenced to be executed. While this man was in prison, he met a young woman. She was the daughter of the prison guard. She visited this man\u2019s prison cell often. They could not always talk together. So he and the woman began to pass notes to each other through the prison bars. They fell in love with each other. When it was time for the prison to execute the man, he sent her one last letter. The last note he sent to her was a love note. He ended it, \u201cfrom, your Valentine.\u201dSome people believe that this is the story that started the holiday we now know as Valentine\u2019s Day. All around the world people celebrate this holiday on February 14th. They celebrate it in many different ways. But the message is the same everywhere \u2014 love! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Valentine\u2019s Day!No one really knows if this story about the man, named Valentine, and the prison guard\u2019s daughter is true. The holiday is actually named after at least two men, both named Valentine. Historians, people who study history, have little information about either of these men. Both men died because of their Christian faith \u2013 one died in 197 and one in 269. Historians believe that both men died on February 14th. Later, the Christian church recognized these men as saints \u2014 people of strong faith. And February 14th became Saint Valentine\u2019s Day.Historical documents show that, originally, Valentine\u2019s Day had little to do with love. A recorded link between Valentine\u2019s Day and love did not appear until about 1,200 years later.In 1382 Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a poem about love. He was a famous English Poet. The poem told about birds coming together half-way through the second month of the year. The birds met on Valentine\u2019s Day, to mate. The poem influenced many people. And soon after, other writers began to use these ideas in their own writing. The link between Valentine\u2019s Day and love became common!By the 17th century, Valentine\u2019s Day was celebrated all over Great Britain. About a hundred years later, people began to exchange small gifts or notes on Valentine\u2019s Day. These gifts were an expression of love between family, friends, and lovers.Today, many people still celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day in this way. They send a greeting card. These are usually just a simple paper note that expresses love or devotion. A person can send a Valentine\u2019s Day greeting card to his lover, his parents, his co-worker, or even his doctor! In fact, the Greeting Card Association says that world-wide, people send over one billion greeting cards every Valentine\u2019s Day!People in Canada, Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Australia all celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day this way. But greeting cards are not the only thing people give or do. People may go out to a special dinner. They may buy each other a present, or just some good-tasting candy or chocolate. Other countries do different things.On Valentine\u2019s Day in Japan, women give sweet candy, chocolate or flowers to people they like. They call this chocolate \u2018giri-choko.\u2019 In Japanese, the word \u2018giri\u2019 means obligation, or, something someone must do. And \u2018choko\u2019 is a short form of the word for chocolate. A woman may also give \u2018honmei-choko\u2019 to a person she loves or is in a relationship with. Or she can give \u2018tomo-choko\u2019 to her friends.This may seem nice for the men. But men who received honmei-choko must also give the women a present. This happens on White Day, one month later. On that day, a man must give the woman a present worth two to three times more than the present he got! Sora News 24 is a Japanese news site. It shared results of a survey about this tradition. Most men do not like it. In the survey, one Japanese man wrote:\u201cI like getting the chocolates. But I hate having to buy every girl something in return. Honmei-choco is even worse, because you have to buy something super expensive on White Day!\u201dIn Finland they celebrate \u2018Friend\u2019s Day\u2019 on February 14. This is not only a day for people in love. But, it is a day for celebrating and remembering your friends.Some places do not celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day at all. But they do celebrate a different day for love. People living in Brazil celebrate \u2018Boyfriend or Girlfriend Day.\u2019 On June 12th, people in love exchange gifts like chocolates, cards, flowers, and even special clothes. Some women even use this day to perform special customs. They believe these customs will help them find a good boyfriend or husband.Colombians celebrate \u2018Love and Friendship Day\u2019 on the 3rd Friday and Saturday in September. And many groups of people join in a popular tradition called \u2018amigo secreto\u2019 or \u2018secret friend.\u2019 Each member of the group chooses another member\u2019s name by chance. He gives the person he chose a gift on this day.So, people in different places celebrate a day like Valentine\u2019s Day. They may celebrate it at a different time of the year. They may give gifts or greeting cards. They may write a special note to many people or to only one person. But there is a common idea in all of these actions. Valentine\u2019s Day is a time to think about the people around you. It is a time to think about the people you love.It is important for people to feel loved. But often, we do not express our love for the people around us. So, Valentine\u2019s Day offers people the perfect chance to tell other people how much you value them. Tell your wife or husband, or girlfriend or boyfriend how much you love them. Tell your parents or children how wonderful they are. Tell your friends how much you like to see them.Do you love someone? You should tell them! Then, tell US about what makes them so wonderful! You can leave a comment on our website.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Mike Procter. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.In 2005 many people watched the documentary \u201cMarch of the Penguins.\u201d This film continues to be popular today. The film shows a real group of birds in Antarctica. It is about their journey to mate and raise their young. But these birds do not fly. The penguins walk together across the ice of Antarctica. Imagine a group of fat black and white birds walking in a line. Suddenly, one penguin loses his balance. He falls on the ice. This happens a few times in the film. Every time penguins fall down people watching the film laugh. The penguins are cute!People liked the film very much. So much, in fact, that police in England think that it may be the reason behind a crime. A man went to a zoo in London and stole a baby penguin. Authorities think that the man stole the penguin after seeing the film. They believe he wanted to give it away as a Christmas gift.What is it about these animals that make people spend money to see a film many times? Why would someone break the law to steal an animal? Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the science behind what makes something cute!Michel Gauthier-Clerc studies penguins. He thinks that many people like penguins. But some people do not understand them. He told the New York Times newspaper,\u201cPeople love the penguin\u2019s way of standing straight upright. They like its colors, which look like human clothes \u2013 a tuxedo suit. And they like the way it waddles as it walks. How like a child playing dress-up in adult clothes!\u201dThese things make penguins seem cute to people. But there are good reasons for all of these things. For example, the way penguins walk. Penguins move from side to side when they walk. People call this way of walking \u2018waddling.\u2019 The penguins may seem to be out of balance. But Doctor Gauthier-Clerc says that the penguins waddle to save energy. In cold Antarctica, penguins must keep warm. The penguins\u2019 colour also has a special purpose. It protects the penguins when they are swimming. From below, larger animals cannot see the penguin\u2019s white underside. It looks the same as the bright sky or ice. And from above, other animals cannot see the penguin\u2019s black back against the dark ocean floor.The penguins\u2019 colours protect them in nature. But scientists have found that some of these physical details also have an effect on humans. These scientists study visual signaling. The way an animal looks sends a message to other animals, and to people. Some of these visual signals make animals seem cute to people.If something is cute, it is beautiful in a special way. Cuteness is a special kind of beauty that makes people happy. Some physical characteristics that people think are cute are big round ears and arms and legs that seem weak. Scientists call these physical details \u201ccute cues.\u201d Cute cues are those things that make something look young, weak, harmless, or needy. Scientists say that humans react to these cues. Humans have a desire to care for things that look and act similar to babies.People often find babies to be very . An adult may have a strong desire to hold a baby and kiss her because she is so cute. Spotlight producer Joshua Leo has a baby daughter. He describes why she is so cute:\u201cMy baby has a very round head. Her head is still very big compared to her body. Her eyes are low on her face and they look big. She has smooth skin and soft hair. My baby daughter does not have much control over her body. She cannot yet move her arms and legs very well.\u201dScientists believe that humans are very sensitive to things that are cute. Humans react to anything that looks similar to a human baby. Humans even react to objects that may look like parts of a baby. Humans react to the soft hair on a baby bird, the movement of a round balloon, a small round car, or even a large round rock on top of a smaller rock! The more cute cues that an animal or object has, the more people may like it.Researchers are still learning about the science of cuteness. Recent studies show that cute images affect the brain in a special way. Cute images make the brain react in a similar way to a good meal or some drugs. Cute things make us feel happy.Cute images have a lot of power. A study done at the University of Michigan in the United States showed this to be true. The study tested young people\u2019s reactions to images. It found that young people believed messages more if the message was joined by a cute picture. The researchers showed the young people two messages. One was a simple anti-smoking message. The other showed a cute animal telling them that smoking was bad. Then the researchers tested the young people\u2019s reactions. The young people trusted the cute messages more than the simple message.Experts say that every human on the planet is made to react to cute images. But some cultures react to cuteness more than others. They say this is similar to the love of sugar. Everyone is able to taste sweet things. But some people and some countries eat more sweet foods than other people.For example, many people in the country of Japan like cute things very much. In Japan cute things are called \u201cKawaii.\u201d Images of people and animals with big heads and big eyes are on many things. Children love Kawaii animals. But these cute things are not only for children. Many Japanese men and women also like Kawaii.Cuteness attracts people. People want to hold and care for cute things. God made humans in a special way. He made us to naturally react to cute things. People are made to protect the helpless things in life, such as small babies. When people see something cute they want to care for it. God gave people this reaction. This way we remember to take good care of things that cannot care for themselves.The writer of this program was Joshua Leo. The producer was Rena Dam.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.Listen for a moment to the  around you. What do you hear? If you live near a busy street maybe it sounds like this:But even in areas far away from busy streets, there can still be a lot of noise. Sometimes this noise can wake you from sleep at night. Other times noise may make it difficult to talk to a friend. This kind of noise is often called noise pollution. It is noise that damages the balance of normal life for people and animals. It can even cause health problems. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on noise pollution.A lot of noise pollution is caused by transportation. Cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes can all be very loud. And in many cities around the world, people\u2019s homes are very close to these transportation systems. But even things like building tools and music can be noise pollution. It is all around us.Noise pollution can be a big problem in developing countries. Growing cities and towns are not planned to reduce noise. Many homes and businesses are built next to busy roads. Traffic grows and with it the noise grows.Researchers have studied the effects of noise in our lives. They have found that it can do more than just take our attention. Noise also harms our health. Most people know that loud noise can permanently damage our ears. But when a person experiences high levels of noise, his heart beats faster. His blood pressure gets higher. Noise can even change the balance of chemicals in a person\u2019s body.Noise can also affect the way a person sleeps at night.  happens when a person is asleep for a long period of time. This is often called \u201cdeep sleep.\u201d But when there is too much noise at night, a person cannot get this deep sleep. Studies show that lack of sleep is connected to many different health problems. If a person is always tired, her body is not as strong. She is not able to fight sickness easily. She may also have a difficult time concentrating on work during the day.In the 1970s, researchers in New York City studied the effects of noise on a school. The school was near noisy train tracks. Some of the rooms of the school faced the train tracks. Other rooms were far from the train. The researchers tested children over six years. The children on the noisy side of the school had lower reading scores than the children on the quiet side of the school. The city made the train tracks quieter. And the school built special walls near the tracks to lessen the sound. After this, reading scores improved.But noise does not just affect humans. Studies show that noise pollution can affect when birds build their nests. Cows feed less and produce less milk when it is noisy. Some studies even show that the growth of some plants can be affected by noise. This is because the noise affects the behavior of the animals around the plants.Louis Hagler is a doctor in California. He fights for quiet in cities. He believes that cities should treat noise pollution like any other dangerous pollution. He told the Washington Post,\u201cWe do not say to people \u2018you just have to learn to live with waste in your water.\u2019 Why should we have to live with waste in our ears?\u201dBut for many people, the problem of noise is not just about a healthy body. It is also about a healthy, peaceful, mind. For many people, quiet is connected to peace.In some religions, holy men and women have special times of silence. Some of these people make a promise not to speak for a period of time. This can be very difficult. But these men and women see their silence as a way to control themselves and honor God.All around the world people make their voices quiet to respect others. People are quiet in cemeteries, where people bury the dead. They are quiet in museums where people learn about art or history. They are quiet in libraries where people read books. People also use silence as a way to honor people who have died. Often, at special events or celebrations, people will have a moment of silence. This is a short time when large groups of people quiet their voices to remember the dead. Quiet and silence is special. It is important.But finding quiet places in a busy world can be difficult. Noise is all around, and sometimes you cannot avoid it. But you can reduce noise in your life. Here are some ways to get rid of noise in your life.Turn off any electrical devices you are not using. These devices can create a low level of noise, even when someone is not using them.If you have to raise your voice when you are talking to someone, something is wrong. Look for what is creating noise around you and what you can do to control it.Play music at a level that only you can hear, or only inside.You can reduce noise coming into and going out of your home by planting tall plants around your home. These plants can block some of the noise that you create.You can also reduce noise inside your home. Hang blankets or fabric on your walls. Put soft rugs or carpet on your floors. These things will help stop noise from reflecting off hard surfaces.Instead of driving a car or riding a motorbike, ride a bicycle instead. This will reduce noise on the roads.And finally, value the quiet places you do know. If you have children, take them to quiet areas and let them listen. Teach them to value quiet in their lives. Make sure to include time for quiet in your own life.How do you escape noise and find quiet? Is there a lot of noise pollution by where you live? Tell us what you think.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Yunzhe Zhou is a job coach. She helps people who are tired of their jobs and need a change. She tells people to try and connect with something that makes them excited and gives them energy. She spoke to the magazine Fast Company:\u201cIf you are giving 1000% percent at your current job, and you still feel like something is missing, it is a good sign that it may not be the right direction.\u201dBut it is not always easy to find the right direction. This is why one ancient idea is becoming popular again: the sabbatical. This time away from work can bring ideas, energy, and a new direction. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on sabbaticals.The idea of a Sabbatical began with the ancient Hebrew law called Sabbath. Traditionally, Jewish people believe that God created the world in six days. On the seventh day, God rested. They believe that God created people to work for six days and then rest for one day. Yet, sabbaticals are no longer just a religious idea. Experts around the world agree that resting from work is good for all people.A sabbatical is not a vacation. A vacation is a time away from work to rest, travel, or spend time with people we love. But a sabbatical is different. Traditionally, a sabbatical is a year off work to travel or study. A person may or may not receive payment for this year. The company Remote Year helps people travel the world while still working over the Internet. They explained sabbaticals on the company website:\u201cSabbaticals are not defined by the lack of work. They are defined by the presence of work. People who are taking sabbaticals today are not taking time off from work for relaxation. They are following another kind of personal or professional work. They are using this time to follow their dreams. They may work to create something that they have been dreaming about for years. They are using it to do a project that they have not been able to work on for years.\u201dThe most common place where people take sabbatical is in university. Usually, a professor gets a sabbatical every seven years. A professor on sabbatical does not have to teach students or meet with other professors. But that does not mean they do nothing. Many professors travel to a new country. Others write a book. Some finish \u00a0a research project. Many professors return with new energy and new ideas. The sabbatical is good for the school, the students, and the professor.In recent years, many businesses noticed that it was not working well to ask people to work more and more. These companies began to offer workers a sabbatical. Two major businesses that offer sabbatical options are McDonald\u2019s and Nike. Some banks and law and accounting firms offer them too. Some companies require a person on sabbatical to volunteer or further their education. But other companies place no requirements on what a person must do.It is easy to understand how a break from work can help a person. But will a break from work help a company? How can working less make someone a better worker? David Burkus is a teacher at Oral Roberts University. He speaks at conferences about leadership. He wrote about sabbaticals for the Harvard Business Review:\u201cThe research found that people who took sabbaticals experienced less stress and an increase in overall well-being. Those positive changes often remained long after the people returned to work. The employees benefit from time away, but the organization benefits as well. The majority of people said the time away gave them the space to have ideas for new projects.\u201dSabbatical programs are still not offered to most people. Does this mean that sabbaticals are only for a few people who teach at a university or work at a company that offers sabbaticals? How can a farmer take a sabbatical? Or a builder? Or writer?Most people in the world work in places where they only get paid if they work. If they do not come to work, they risk losing their position. But as companies around the world start to see the advantage of offering sabbaticals, more are beginning to offer them.The Hilton Hotel gave sabbaticals to workers from Sri Lanka and Singapore. Starbucks Coffee offers some workers in China up to a year-long sabbatical. In India there has been increasing interest in sabbaticals. People are finding ways to work less, travel, and experience life. Mario D\u2019Souza works in marketing. He wanted to take a sabbatical, but his company did not offer one. He decided to make his own sabbatical. He told Fortune India:\u201cI had to plan for this break. I do not get paid for this time. So I have had to think through expenses. I stopped doing things such as eating out, watching films and ordering food. But it has been great! The amount of money I spent on these kind of things was amazing. I only understood when I made myself do this.\u201dBut what about people who cannot afford to take time away from work? Everyone needs time to rest from their work. There are several ways that people can make rest part of their lives.The first idea is to take one day off from work each week. You rest, spend time with family, or gather with your religious community. The second thing is to take one day each month and disconnect from everything. Leave your phone at home and go outside. Walk through nature. Sit and do nothing. Slow down and think about your life.Maybe your life does not permit either of those things. One final thing may still be possible: disconnect for one hour each day. One hour each day may not feel possible. So, start with ten minutes and then build up to one hour. By taking this time you will be more productive. But you may also live a happier life!If you could take a sabbatical, what would you do? Have you taken a sabbatical before? Did it help you?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A mother sits and rocks her baby to sleep. She sings quietly. She wants the baby to fall asleep. She sings this song about a cradle \u2013 a small bed for a baby:Rock-a-bye baby in the tree top.When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.When the branch breaks, the cradle will fall.And down will come baby, cradle and all.Rock-a-bye Baby is a rhyming song from England. The sentences rhyme \u2013 they end with the same sounds like \u2018fall\u2019 and \u2018all\u2019. Rhyming songs and poems are very popular all around the world. Parents often sing them to young children. And children sing them in nursery school \u2013 when they are only three or four years old. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on nursery rhymes around the world.Most countries have  rhymes. People sing nursery rhymes like a song. Or sometimes they say nursery rhymes like a poem. Nursery rhymes are fun for both adults and children. But nursery rhymes also have other purposes.There are different kinds of nursery rhymes. Some nursery rhymes are for helping a child to fall asleep. \u201cRock-a-bye Baby\u201d is one of these. Other nursery rhymes are educational. They teach children about cultural traditions or about good behavior. Some nursery rhymes are games \u2013 they include movements. The children must do these movements with their hands or bodies.Let\u2019s listen to some different kinds of nursery rhymes from around the world. This first nursery rhyme is from Uganda in East Africa:Keep keep keep your healthEat good food!Milk and eggs, fish and beansAre excellent for you.Comb comb comb your hairDo not forget your teeth!Brush brush brush your teethClean up all those germs!This nursery rhyme teaches children about healthy food. And it teaches children to take care of their bodies. Because it has rhyming sounds, this song is easy to remember! Parents and teachers often use songs to teach lessons. Songs can help children to remember important things \u2013 like cleaning their teeth.The next nursery rhyme also uses rhyming to teach. This poem is from China. It teaches about the traditional customs of a very important Chinese holiday. It is called \u2018Chinese New Year\u2019:You will find whenever the New Year comesthe Kitchen God will want some plums.The girls will want some flowers new;The boys will want firecrackers, too.A new soft hat will please PapaAnd a sugar cake for dear Mama.This nursery rhyme teaches children about the special customs of the Chinese New Year holiday. For example, families celebrate Chinese New Year with special food. The nursery rhyme also teaches children to share with their family members. By repeating this rhyme, children will remember their traditional customs.Many cultures also have nursery rhymes to teach children about right and wrong actions. Here is a nursery rhyme from Thailand. It is named after a large fruit. The jackfruit has a hard, green skin. But inside, it has soft, yellow fruit around big seeds:Jum-Jee Jackfruit SeedThose who have done good deedsCan eat all the food.Those who tell liesMust eat old dead dog!This nursery rhyme teaches children to tell the truth. It explains that people who tell the truth will get good things. But people who do not tell the truth will not get good things.There are two more interesting things about this nursery rhyme. One is that it uses words that are not real! The beginning words \u2013 \u201cJum-Jee\u201d \u2013 do not mean anything. These are just words that sound fun. They rhyme to make the song sound good. Many nursery rhymes have these kinds of words in them.The Jum-Jee nursery rhyme is also a game. While the children sing it, they sit in a circle. They all put their hands into the middle. Then, one child counts the other children\u2019s fingers while they sing together. When the song is finished, the child stops counting. The person with the finger last counted must pull their hand away. The song continues until only one child has a hand left in the middle of the circle.Many other nursery rhymes can also be used for games. Some have special motions for the children to do. They sing and move parts of their bodies at the same time. Listen to this nursery rhyme from Switzerland in Europe. It is a rhyme about a child named Joggeli riding a horse. Imagine how children would move while saying it.Joggeli, can you ride?Yes, yes, yes.Have you got one leg each side?Yes, yes, yes.Did you give the horse some hay?Yes, yes, yes.Did you water it today?Nay, nay, nay.So let\u2019s ride to townAnd go three times around.But then the horse starts buckingAnd Joggeli falls down down down.Nursery rhymes can teach many things! They can teach children about being healthy and behaving well. They also teach about traditional culture. Nursery rhymes often use language in a fun way. And they can be used for movements or games. But one of the most important things about nursery rhymes is that they help create relationships.Nursery rhymes help children create friendships with each other. They help teachers to give good lessons. And they also help create closeness between a child and her parent. Nursery rhymes are a way for parents to teach important lessons.Lastly, parents use nursery rhymes to put their children to sleep \u2013 like the first rhyme we heard.\u00a0 The last nursery rhyme is also a song from a parent to his child. The child is named Iro. This rhyme is from the Mina language of Benin, in West Africa. It shows the most important lesson that a parent can teach a child: that her mother and father love her.My Iro, what am I going to give you?My Iro, what am I going to give you?I have nothing to give you I am going to pray for you.Your life will be happy for all time.What is your favorite nursery rhyme?

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.Most people have experienced an immediate reaction. Think about the last time you smelled something delicious. Did you react with an emotion? Have you had a reaction to a beautiful piece of art? Did you react emotionally when you saw someone you loved?Malcolm Gladwell is a writer. He writes about how our brains are influenced by things we do not even know. Gladwell calls these immediate reactions we just thought about snap judgements, or quick decisions. They often influence us in ways we may not even recognize. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on these immediate reactions and how they affect our everyday lives.Here is a fun example of how our brains create these immediate reactions. Answer these questions as quickly as possible.What color are clouds? What color is snow? What do cows drink?Most people answer the first two questions with \u201cwhite\u201d. But they answer the third question with the word \u201cmilk\u201d. If you answered that cows drink milk, you are not alone. The correct answer is water. It was the color white that made you have a snap decision that cows drink milk.Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book about snap judgements called \u201cBlink\u201d. In this book, he tells a story about a snap decision. In 1983, the J. Paul Getty Museum received a statue. They believed it was from the sixth century B.C. Scientists at the museum did some basic tests to make sure the statue was real. The tests seemed to show that the statue was very old.Thomas Hoving is an art manager. He looked at the statue. Hoving always remembers the first word to come into his mind when he looks at a new piece of work. Normally, when Hoving sees an old, large marble statue, his first word is \u201cold\u201d, \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cancient\u201d, or even \u201cheavy\u201d. Hoving has been around art for many years. His experience makes it easier for him to choose between real art and copies of real art. And when he looked at the statue, the first word he thought of was \u201cfresh\u201d. His snap judgement made him think the statue was not thousands of years old. It was new.Scientists decided to do more tests. These further test results showed that the statue was not real. It was a very good copy of a real statue. The person who made the statue worked hard to make the statue seem old. The museum was not happy when they learned they would not be able to put this statue in their museum. But this snap decision saved the museum from years of shame and regret.This is just one example of the effects of snap judgements or quick decisions. Snap judgements can also help improve \u2013 or even save \u2013 our lives.Imagine you are walking down a street on a sidewalk. You are thinking about something that is very interesting. You are not thinking about walking down the street. You decide to turn right. You do not see that you have just stepped out on to a busy street. You look up and see that there is a car driving toward you. Without thinking, you jump back up on to the sidewalk. You do this to avoid being hit. It was your own quick decision to jump back, away from the street, that saved you from being hurt.In an emergency, quick decisions also help. For example, doctors use snap judgements to treat injuries. They react based on past experiences. These past experiences help doctors know, without thinking, what they must do. If doctors take too long to make a decision, it can be too late to save a person\u2019s life. Their quick thinking can help keep everyone safe.Gladwell says that people make quick decisions because they must. Sometimes people must make quick decisions to survive. Other times, people make them because it is natural. Our past experiences help to form our decisions. This is what helps to make them natural. Snap judgements come from the unconscious part of our brain. So, we do not know we are making snap judgements until after we make them. We often do this when we meet people.There is a common saying in the English language: \u201cDo not judge a book by its cover\u201d. This means that we should not make an opinion about something or somebody based on the way they look. But people do this every single day. And, sadly, these snap judgements can easily be wrong.Snap judgements come from experience. But our experiences of people can be limited. Many of us do not know people of a different ethnicity or race. We mostly know people who are like us. So, when we see someone who looks different, our snap judgements are  based on experience. They are based on ideas from other people. Or they are based on stories in radio and television. These are prejudices. And snap judgements based on prejudice are often wrong. Often, a person\u2019s appearance does not tell us much about who they are or what they are like.It is natural to make snap judgements about other people. However, these judgements are not always true. For example, imagine that you see a person with a different skin color than yours. You may have a thought like \u201cI am smarter than he is\u201d or \u201cHe is mean\u201d. These are not good snap judgements. Thoughts like these are judgements about a person\u2019s character and abilities.Sometimes, we need to make a quick decision about a person to protect our own lives. If we see someone carrying a weapon, it would be right to make the snap judgement to hide or run away.People make snap judgements every single day. But we can decide how we let the snap judgements affect our lives. It is important to be careful not to let these quick decisions change the way we think of a person. Think of how your snap judgements affect your everyday life. You could surprise yourself.We will tell another story about snap judgements for members of our YouTube channel.

This week\u2019s program is about the COVID pandemic and our stories during that pandemic \u2013 how the pandemic affected each of us and how people experienced that worldwide problem. This program was written before we knew very much about the Delta variant and other variants that are affecting populations all around the world. And while this program does have a hopeful ending \u2013 and I do think that we will get through this \u2013 we also want to acknowledge and let you know that we know there is still a lot of pain around COVID around the world. This is not a problem that is going away soon and it needs all of us working together to make it go away and to make it better. So we hope that when you listen to this program you hear about the experiences that people around the world have had. We want to hear about your experiences too. But we also want you to hear the hope that people do have for finally getting through this pandemic. We hope that you enjoy this program.Welcome to Spotlight. I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.We begin today\u2019s program with a story from March 2020.\u201cIt was almost midnight. My roommate and I had been hanging out. It had been more than a week since we had left the house, because of the lockdown. So, we decided to go for a walk. No one was wearing masks, then. But there was also no one around. We walked to an intersection of streets. Normally, it would be crowded with people. Even on the weekdays, many people went to the bars. And a lot of cars travelled through. But there was no one. I remember I walked to the middle of the street. And then I lay down. I lay there for several minutes. No cars came. Nothing that night seemed real. Nothing seemed real for many nights after.\u201dThis is a program about the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. 2020 was unlike any other year. A new coronavirus named SARS-COV-2 spread through the whole world. It led to the disease COVID-19. And it changed everyone\u2019s lives. Countries shut down. People had to make big changes to the way they worked, shopped, and had relationships. When the pandemic began, these changes seemed strange. But soon, the restrictions seemed normal. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the coronavirus pandemic. It is about how that first year felt. We tell stories from different people around the world. We look at their experiences during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.Many people\u2019s first experience was not with the virus itself. They first experienced measures designed to prevent the virus\u2019 spread. Xiang Zhao is a researcher from Austria. But he is originally from China. He was visiting his family when COVID-19 began to spread. Zhao wrote about his experiences in the journal Health Communication. He wrote,\u201cSeveral apartments with infections were blocked by a thick metal bar on the door. This was an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. One night, I walked on a big bridge. I saw the new shopping mall I had not visited yet. I saw the restaurant where I had rice noodles last year. I saw the shop where I got a globe model when I was a child. All of these memories rushed into my head with the beautiful, but empty night view. A strong sense of isolation came over me. I felt extremely alone. I have no previous experience with such an outbreak. I was only a high school student when SARS happened. It did not affect my life very much.\u201dLoneliness was a common experience with the pandemic. Many people also experienced how terrible the loneliness could be. June Perry lives in the United States. Her father lived in a nursing home, where medical professionals would take care of him. COVID-19 was especially dangerous for older people. Someone in this nursing home caught COVID-19. The disease spread like a fire in a dry forest. And June was not able to see her father. She told NPR:\u201cWe saw my father through the window. It was very, very sad. He had signs of  before he went to the nursing home. He did not know that people were dying around him. He did not know that three people near him had died of COVID. Six months after lockdown, he died alone, with nobody beside him.\u201dThe isolation affected all people greatly. Most did not go out to work. They did not see their friends or family. It was like everything in the world had stopped. Several Italian scientists studied this feeling for the journal Frontiers in Psychology. They asked almost 3,000 students about their experiences. One, a 16-year-old, told the scientists:\u201cIt is bad to wake up in the morning knowing that you cannot accomplish anything with your life. You cannot do anything. I look out the window, and it is all deserted. There are no more sounds of cars, buses, or people talking. It is like a changed world, like being in prison for something that you did not do. All I can do is wait and stay at home.\u201dWhen people caught COVID-19, they were not just afraid for themselves. Being infected meant people close to them could also be infected. This Coronavirus was a very new virus. Scientists did not know very much about it. People did not know how it would affect their loved ones. Angela Brangaccio had just given birth. Then doctors told her she was positive for COVID-19. She was afraid for herself, but she was also afraid for her child. She told to NPR,\u201cAll I knew was that I had this three-month-old baby. I was so scared of anything happening to her. I felt so sick. I could not think how this virus would feel in a three-month-old body. The pain that you feel when you are sick: If my baby feels like this, I cannot go on. <br>In the end, I decided I would move into a different room. I did not spend much time with my baby. I could not kiss her. I kept my mask on all the time. It was so hard. I am not joking when I say it was the worst 14 days of my life.\u201dBy the end of 2020, there seemed to be some hope. SARS-COV 2 had destroyed many lives. But countries were also developing  for the virus. The vaccines would protect most people from getting seriously sick if they were infected. Scientists even believed that they might also prevent infection. By early 2021, some countries had vaccinated some of their population.In many places COVID-19 cases began to fall. But there was still a lot to do to beat COVID. Many people still could not get the vaccines. But people began to think that there might be a life beyond the lockdown. They began to imagine a future where everyone could be safe again.How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect you? Do you remember when you first heard of COVID-19? What was your experience like?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Does your language use any English words? Yes? No? Hello? Languages often borrow words from each other. English speakers use many words that have come from other languages. For example, you may hear an English speaker say something like this:\u201cI cannot believe I made that faux pas in front of everyone!\u201dThe words \u201cfaux pas\u201d mean a social mistake. They are French. But many English speakers use them.Another example is the word \u201cprima donna.\u201d This phrase is Italian. It means \u201cfirst lady.\u201d English speakers use it to speak about someone who only thinks about themselves.Many languages also use English words. For example, they use the words computer, internet and email. However, none of these are the most commonly used English word. Do you know what it is? Okay. Yes, the word is okay. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the word okay.The word okay is an informal, spoken word. You will almost never find it in formal speeches, news media, or books. But it is one of the most common English words. It is also one of the most common English exports from the United States! English professor Allen Metcalfe wrote a book about the word okay. He told CBS News,\u201cThere is no other word that is as widely recognized throughout the whole world. No other American English word has had so much success like that.\u201dIn a general way, okay signals approval, acceptance, or agreement. People can use it in many different ways. Here are some ways to use the word okay.First, okay can be an adjective or an adverb. It can describe an act or a thing. In this way, it means \u201call right\u201d or \u201cfine.\u201dHere is another example:It can also mean fine, but not so great.Okay can also be an act or a thing \u2013 a verb or a noun.Okay is also common as an interjection. It can appear suddenly, on its own. In this way, it can simply mean \u201cyes\u201d or \u201csure.\u201dOr it can signal that people need to attend.It can also mean \u201cenough!\u201dOkay, we are done with this part anyway.You have already heard how many different meanings the word okay has. But did you know that the meaning also changes depending on how you say it? The tone of a person\u2019s voice makes a difference. The meaning can change no matter how you use it. For example, the sentence \u201cIt was okay\u201d could be positive or negative.What do you think this person meant? What about this next example?The first answer says that the person was not really satisfied, but he could not think of something bad to say. The second answer says that the person was satisfied. A person\u2019s tone also changes the meaning of the word okay as an interjection.The first person used okay to ask for agreement. The second person used okay to express questioning, or doubt. Okay is a small word, but it has many different uses!So where did this confusing, complex word come from? People debate the origin of the word okay. The earliest record in print was in 1839\u00a0in the city of Boston. At the time, it was popular to use groups of letters to signal words. It was also common to spell the words incorrectly, using the wrong letters, as a joke. A Boston newspaper used the letters \u201cO\u201d and \u201cK\u201d to mean \u201coll korrect.\u201d The O meant \u201call\u201d, and the K meant \u201ccorrect\u201d.Around the same time, US President Martin Van Buren began to use the word. He was the president, and he was trying to get elected again. His political party used the saying, \u201cVote for OK.\u201d Van Buren was from a town in New York called Kinderhook. In this case, he used the letters OK to mean \u201cOld Kinderhook.\u201d The saying tried to give the message that Old Kinderhook was \u201call correct.\u201d Van Buren lost the election. But many language experts think that the election saying helped to make \u201cOK\u201d a common word.This explanation may also explain the unusual spelling of the word okay. People can write okay in two ways. They can write the word using just the letters \u201cO\u201d and \u201cK\u201d. Or they can write it this way: o-k-a-y. And both ways are correct!Other language experts think the word has a Native American origin. The Choctaw people are one of many Native American groups. The Choctaw language has a word \u201cokeh.\u201d This word means \u201cit is so.\u201d This is almost the same meaning as today\u2019s word \u201cokay.\u201d As early as 1825, Christian Bible translators used \u201cokeh\u201d in their Choctaw Bible translations. In the 20th\u00a0century, US President Woodrow Wilson used the Choctaw language to sign documents as \u201cokeh.\u201dOther language experts say that okay came from West Africa. Some West African languages have interjection words that sound similar to okay. For example, the word \u201cwaw-kay\u201d in the Bantu and Wolof languages, or \u201co ke\u201d in the Mande language. These words also commonly signal agreement. West African people were brought to the United States as slaves. The theory is that African slaves used these words when speaking English. After a time, the use spread to the rest of the English-speaking population.No one knows which story is true. But today, okay is now one of the most common words in English. People use it all the time, everywhere. Okay is now an international word. But Professor Metcalf believes that it expresses a cultural value of the United States. He told CBS News,\u201cIt is strong, it is simple. People from the United States do not like complex ways of life. And \u2018okay\u2019 is about as short and simple as you can get.\u201dOK.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where is the world they live.Imagine these situations. A young man is walking in the hills. But he is lost. It is getting dark. The man cannot see anything. He falls and hurts his leg. Now he cannot walk and needs help immediately. But he does not know where he is. He cannot ask anyone to come and help him. He does not know how to tell anyone where to find him.A young woman is at an outdoor music event. During the event, she is planning to stay in a tent with her friends. She knows which field they are in. So, she walks around the field looking for them. But she cannot find their tent. She does not know how to find the exact position of her friends.Have you ever been in a situation like this? We do not always know where we are \u2014 even with modern technology. This can be annoying in some situations. But it can be very dangerous in other situations. Chris Sheldrick has created something that helps people when they face a problem like this. It helps people all over the world who cannot give an address or say where they are. It is called what3words. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on Chris Sheldrick and his app what3words.Chris Sheldrick lives in the United Kingdom. He worked in the music industry for ten years. He organised music events around the world. But every day he had problems with addresses. Musicians and people bringing their equipment often got lost when they tried to find an event. One day in Italy, a driver unloaded equipment at a place one hour north of Rome. But he should have unloaded it one hour  of Rome.Sheldrick tried to get the people he worked with to use longitude and latitude to find where to meet. Marking places like this is exact. But it creates a line of 16 numbers to mark the place. It is too difficult to use. Sheldrick wondered if he could change these numbers into something easier.Sheldrick had a friend who worked with mathematics. The two men worked together on this problem for six months. They found a simple way to talk about where a person was \u2013 their location. In a TED talk, Sheldrick explained what they did:\u2018We divided the world into three-meter squares. We found that we could name every three-meter square in the world separately with just three words. We used 40,000 words which is more than enough for the trillions of squares.\u2019So the men gave every square or place a separate three-word address. For example, their company building in London has the address \u2018filled.count.soap\u2019. And the door of the UK Prime Minister is \u2018slurs.this.shark.\u2019Sheldrick called this new system . He built an app people can use to find places this way. He knew that it could do much more than get musicians to the right place. He believed that what3words could help billions of people in the world who still live without an address. He told the Guardian,\u2018If you think about addresses, some are from centuries ago. Some are from last week. But there is so much of the world that does not use them. Complete countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, have only ever used directions.\u2019Sheldrick knew that people without an address sometimes struggle to get the same services as people who do have an address. For example, if you do not have an address you will find it hard to get a bank account, be listed to vote or receive a letter. So his company built what3words into many languages from Arabic to Urdu. This means what3words can help people in countries that do not have a good address system. It can help people in life or death situations. It can even help businesses work better.In his TED talk, Sheldrick explained some of the ways that what3words has already been used.\u2018In Durban, South Africa, an organisation called Gateway Health provided 11,000 three word address signs in their community. Pregnant mothers can call the emergency services and use the signs to explain exactly where to find them. In the past, the ambulances have often taken hours to find the pregnant mothers. In Mongolia, the National Post Service uses the system. They are now taking mail to many people for the first time. The United Nations are using it to mark photos or pictures in disaster or trouble areas. They can then take aid to exactly the right place. Even Domino\u2019s Pizza use it in the Caribbean. They want to get their food to people while it is still hot.\u2019People all over the world use the what3words app. It is free to emergency services and individuals. In the United Kingdom, Jess Tinsley and her friends went for a walk. But they got lost. It was dark and wet, and Tinsley was near to tears. She said,\u2018We were in a field and had no idea where we were.\u2019She got a phone signal and called the emergency services. They told her to use the what3words app.\u00a0 She quickly did this. The emergency services knew where she was in less than a minute. Soon they found and rescued Tinsley and her friends.In Uganda, what3words worked with the Community Development Centre to bring 3word addresses to refugee camps in the area of Arua. The Centre will discover and record 3word addresses for every home and important building in the camp. This means health workers will be able to find people who need medical services. But it means much more than this. Sebit Martin is a leader at the Community Development Centre. On the what3words website, Martin explained why it was important for refugees to have an address.\u2018We want to give refugees the self-respect they deserve. We can improve their living conditions. 3word addresses will give everyone an easy way of talking about places. But these addresses are also a better language of hope in the refugee camp.\u2019Do you have an address? Have you ever had problems finding a place? Would this app help you? Tell us about it.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.A crowd of people is standing in a circle. They are watching a young man perform. There is a music player next to him. It is playing loud music with a strong beat. He is performing amazing dance moves. The young man is spinning on his head. He is jumping and flipping with the music. He is wearing a hat and large trousers. The hat helps his head slide across the surface. And the large trousers hide thick pads that cover and protect his knees.This young man is not performing just any normal dance. This kind of dance is called \u201cbreaking\u201d or \u201cbreakdance.\u201d A dancer who does this kind of dance is a \u201cbboy\u201d or \u201cbgirl.\u201d Today\u2019s Spotlight is on breaking and the people who perform it.Breaking began in the United States in the 1970s. A man called Kool Herc liked to have parties at his home in New York City. He played music and people danced. He was very skilled at mixing the songs together and playing the best parts of each song.Each song had a part where the words stopped, but the music continued. The music had only quick drumming and rhythm. This was called the \u201cbreak\u201d of the song. Kool Herc played these parts over and over. People danced longer when he played more breaks. They called the dance \u2018breaking.\u2019 And Kool Herc called the dancers at his parties \u2018bboys\u2019 and \u2018bgirls.\u2019Kool Herc\u2019s parties also began a new part of culture. It was based around a particular kind of music. People called it Hip Hop. Breaking is just one part of Hip Hop. It includes different kinds of music: rapping and DJing. It also includes graffiti. This is the art of painting words and pictures on walls, often without permission.Over time, bboys and bgirls created different kinds of basic steps to breaking. The first is called \u2018Toprock\u2019. This is when the dancer jumps around on his feet when he first begins dancing. He listens to the rhythm of the music and first starts moving.The second kind of step in breaking is called \u2018Downrock\u2019. This part of breaking uses the hands and feet on the floor. A dancer moves around on the floor in creative ways. Her hands and feet equally support her movements. She rolls and turns. She moves her arms and legs around into shapes.The most difficult part of breaking is \u2018power.\u2019 This move requires a lot of skill and strength. A dancer\u2019s head and shoulders are near the ground. But his legs are in the air. In this position, he turns in a fast circle. This kind of move often makes the crowd very happy.The last kind of move is a \u2018freeze.\u2019 This is when the dancer suddenly stops moving in a surprising position. She stays very still when the music changes or stops. A dancer may also end her dance with a move called a \u201csuicide\u201d. In this move, a dancer acts as if she is going to fall. It looks painful and dangerous. But she controls her fall so she is not hurt.In the 1980s, breaking became very popular. Bboys and bgirls appeared on television. They danced in movies. Suddenly, everyone knew about this special dance!These television performances were the first time many people saw women dancing in this way. The bgirls flipped and danced just like the bboys. They performed difficult dance moves. They were just as strong and creative as the bboys. This surprised many people watching the performance.Today there are still many more bboys than bgirls. Breaking takes a lot of strength. It is a powerful dance. Many people see the dance as only for men. But more and more women are learning. There are special groups and competitions only for women.In fact, competitions are important to breaking. Breaking competitions are called battles. Two groups of dancers compete against each other. Each group stands on one side of a circle. People gather around the circle to watch the competition. A DJ starts to play music. Three judges sit at the edge of the circle and watch.The first person goes to the middle of the circle and breaks. When he is done, a dancer from the other team dances in the center. She tries to dance better than the first person. Each person from each group dances once in the middle of the circle.After every person from both groups has danced, the judges choose a winning group. The judges choose the team with the most skill, best attitude, and the most interesting moves. After the battle, the groups often talk to each other. They shake hands with each other. When the battle is over, they often become friends. They have learned to respect each other\u2019s creativity and skill.Battles like this are one way that breaking builds communities. Sometimes people who do not agree can meet together for a battle. They compete with each other through dance instead of violence. They learn to respect each other. Sometimes dancers even meet together to practice after the battle. They learn from each other.Breaking has this effect all over the world. There are bboys and bgirls on every continent. The dance is a little different in each country. But the style and basic steps are the same.Often, people combine breaking with other kinds of performance. People in Japan and South Korea combine breaking with martial arts. These fighting sports include karate, kung fu, and taekwondo. Breakers add kicks and punches to the dance. They move in short, quick motions. Their clothes also show an influence from martial arts. These dancers may wear traditional breaking clothes and martial arts clothes together. They may wear white pants. Or they may wear a colored piece of cloth around their heads.In Brazil, dancers add the fighting sport of capoeira to their breaking. They move around the floor with straight legs. They create shapes in the air with their arms and legs. They move very smoothly when they dance.In South Africa, dancers add traditional tribal dance steps to their breaking. They pump their hands in the air. They step their feet hard on the ground. They dance with strength and energy.In the United States, bboys and bgirls add the sport of gymnastics to their dance. They balance their bodies on their arms. They jump and flip in the air.Breaking is more than just a dance. It is an important way to build community. Around the world people have discovered how this dance can bring people together.The writer of this program was Johanna Poole. The producer was Liz Waid.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It is a warm day in Jakarta, Indonesia. A young woman sits in her car. The traffic is busy.\u00a0 None of the cars are able to move. The woman looks at the empty driving lane next to her. This space is a special part of the road. It is only for buses and emergency vehicles. As she watches, a car drives past. This car is driving in the special lane. She recognizes the car.\u00a0 It is the car of a government official named Salim Segaf Aljufri! She holds up her telephone.\u00a0 She takes a picture. She puts the picture on the Internet using Twitter. Many people see the picture on this social media website. The very next day, the police appear at Aljufri\u2019s office. And they give him a fine for breaking traffic laws!The Internet is a powerful tool for communication, learning, and sharing. But it is also a tool for political change. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on how Indonesians are using the Internet to change their government and society.Indonesia is a large country in Southeast Asia. Over 240 million people live there. For the last 20 years, Indonesia has worked to become a fully democratic state.\u00a0 Much of that work has been successful. However, many Indonesians still identify problems with their country. Some citizens  about poor government. Others worry about the country\u2019s lack of security. And still others describe the country\u2019s poor economic situation.Many Indonesians work hard to change these negative issues. Some citizens protest to show their opposition. Others join political movements or work with social organizations to encourage social change. But most recently, Indonesians have been working for change in a new way \u2013 by using social media.Indonesians are major users of social media. They enjoy using these Internet websites to connect with other people. Nearly 17% of Indonesians uses social media websites every day. The most popular social media websites are Twitter and Facebook. And Indonesia has the second highest number of Facebook users in all of Asia.This high use of social media has begun to influence how Indonesians encourage change.\u00a0 More and more people are using social media to share their opinions about social and political issues. Social media helps many Indonesians become involved. It helps them feel like they have power to influence their government. And news spreads more quickly. If a politician says or does something wrong, people can discuss it on social media. And this can change public opinion.In October of 2012, social media influenced the actions of the Indonesian President. In the Indonesian government, there is a group called the Corruption Eradication Commission or KPK. The KPK works to find corrupt or dishonest officials. Corrupt officials often accept money or bribes to do illegal things for people. The KPK works to find corruption and punish the people responsible.In 2012, the KPK was investigating one of the country\u2019s top police officials. The police were not happy with the KPK\u2019s investigation. The police were using their power to block the KPK\u2019s work. This action made many Indonesians angry. They believed the KPK should be able to work freely. So they talked about it on social media.On Facebook, people started a \u201cSave KPK\u201d movement. And on Twitter, \u201cSave KPK\u201d became a very popular conversation subject. People criticized the President for being quiet on the issue. The \u201cSave KPK\u201d movement became so popular that news organizations were talking about it!\u00a0 Soon, the President ordered the police to stop interfering with the KPK investigation. And he said that Indonesians on social media made it clear that he needed to act!Social media has also been important for Indonesians who are fighting for their rights. In 2008, Prita Mulyasari had a terrible experience at the hospital. Her doctors treated her poorly. They told her wrong information about her condition. And they ordered tests that were not needed. She was very angry about her experience. When she got home, she wrote an email about it to friends and family.Some of Mulyasari\u2019s friends sent the email to other people. Soon, it spread all over the Internet. A news organization even reported on it! And Mulyasari\u2019s doctors saw the report. They were angry, too. They did not think Mulyasari should have written negative things about them. So they took her to court. They wanted her to pay money and to go to prison.Many people in Indonesia believed the doctors were wrong. But, they also thought the doctors would probably win.\u00a0 They believed this because the doctors had money to pay for a good legal expert. And Mulyasari did not. So, a group of people started a movement on Facebook. The movement raised money to help Mulyasari pay for her court case. Without the power of the Internet, Mulyasari probably would have lost her case.\u00a0 But in 2012, court officials ruled that Mulyasari was innocent. It was because of social media that Mulyasari did not go to prison for expressing her opinion.Social media is a way for people to easily and quickly share their ideas and experiences. Sometimes, this can create action and influence real change. However, it does not always lead to permanent change. In Mulyasari\u2019s case, politicians became involved. Her simple email became a national discussion about health care and the courts. But, court officials did not change any laws. Arjuna Dibley is a writer for the magazine Inside Indonesia. She wrote about the Mulyasari case. She talked about why there was no change in the law. She said:\u201cToday, social media action in Indonesia is concentrated on short messages and quick reaction to new cases. Social media lacks the long term, deep power required to create legal changes. Mulyasari\u2019s case shows that once the early popularity of a particular case is gone, the discussion \u2018moves on\u2019 to new issues.\u00a0 But the difficult, complex and longer term goal of creating legal change remains unanswered.\u201dWhat do you think about social media?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Christy VanArragon. Spotlight uses a special English method of Broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.It was a sunny day on the East coast of the United States. Joni Eareckson Tada was 17 years old. She was standing by a lake. Tada began a strong dive into the water. She did not know that in a moment her life would change forever. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the amazing life of Joni Eareckson Tada.Tada dove head-first into the lake. But the water was not deep. She hit her head on the bottom of the lake. She heard a loud quick noise. After that, she could not move. Tada was trapped under the water. She wanted to call for help. But she could not open her mouth under the water. No matter how hard she tried, Tada could not get up. She did not understand what was happening. She was holding her breath. But she could not last much longer under the water.Finally, Tada\u2019s sister, Kathy, pulled her out of the water. Tada could finally breathe. But she still could not move her arms or legs. An emergency vehicle brought Tada to the hospital. She was very frightened. She asked Kathy to hold her hand while they were waiting. Kathy told Tada that she was already doing that. Tada was surprised. She could not feel her sister\u2019s hand.At the hospital, doctors discovered that Tada had broken an important bone in her neck. She was now a quadriplegic. She could not feel or move any part of her body below her shoulders. And this condition would never change. Tada was in the hospital for a long time. She thought she would probably die. She did not die. But her life, as she knew it, had changed completely.Tada experienced intense depression for a long time. At first, she could not accept what had happened to her. She thought it was unfair that she would never move her body again. She was angry that her life had changed so much. She wanted to die. She wrote about her experiences:\u201cI asked many of my friends to assist me in suicide. I wanted to find a final escape. I could not face the possibility of sitting down for the rest of my life without the use of my hands, without the use of my legs. All my hopes seemed destroyed.\u201dBut then Tada began to have more hopeful thoughts. She was a Christian. Before the accident, she felt like she was not living her life very well. She had prayed that God would change her. She wanted to be a better person. And now, after months of depression Tada had a new idea. She wondered if the accident might have been God\u2019s answer to her prayer. Tada began to study the Christian Bible. She read what God teaches about pain, suffering, and healing. Tada says:\u201cI have discovered that God can heal. He does heal. But he is not required to heal\u2026 He has shown me that my suffering is part of a better plan.\u201dToday Tada believes that her  was the beginning of a long and difficult process. It was the process of becoming more like Jesus Christ. Tada writes:\u201cGod used this injury to develop in me patience and endurance and tolerance and self-control and steadfastness and sensitivity and love and joy. Those things did not matter much to me when I was on my feet. But, oh boy, they began to matter after I began living in a wheelchair.\u201dTada learned that her worth did not depend on being able to move her body. Instead, she could use her situation to help people who were dealing with suffering. And Tada has done this in many ways. She has written over 50 books for people of all ages. Tada learned to paint beautiful pictures. She paints by holding a paintbrush in her mouth! Tada has also worked with government officials to help people with disabilities. She is a singer, a speaker, a writer, an actor, a wife, and an encouragement to many people.Tada is the president of a group called . It is a group that helps people with disabilities in many countries. Every day Joni broadcasts a short radio program for Joni and Friends. Her program is broadcast in many different countries. She tries to help people understand pain and suffering. She encourages everyone to work with people with disabilities. Nate Dell works with Spotlight English. He went to see Joni Eareckson Tada at a conference in 2015. He told Spotlight how she changed the way he thinks:\u201cI had heard of Joni before I ever got to see her speak. Before, her quadriplegia seemed to be just a discussion starter for her message. But Joni parked her chair right beside where I was sitting! And I saw how her disability affects every part of her life. She had two women helping her. They held a water bottle for Joni to drink from. They helped her wipe her nose. They even adjusted her clothing. I do all of these things without even thinking about it! Joni\u2019s message is that God loves us \u2013 even through difficult circumstances and suffering. Hearing this message from a wheelchair was very powerful.\u201dTada has continued to have struggles. She often has problems with her muscles. She feels a lot of pain. In 2010, Tada had treatment for breast cancer. But throughout all these difficulties, Tada kept her trust in God. She says:\u201cMy weakness, that is, my quadriplegia, is my greatest strength. It forces me into the arms of Christ every single morning when I get up.\u201dIn 2014 Tada recorded a song. It became very famous. Over a million people watched the Youtube video of \u201c.\u201d We end today\u2019s program with some words from this song. They show Joni Eareckson Tada\u2019s faith, and the strength it brings her every day of her life.\u201cI will not be bent in fear.God is the shelter I know is near.In His strength I find my own.By His faithful mercies shown.When my steps are lost and desperate for a guide,I can feel his touch, a soothing presence by my side.I am alone yet not alone.\u201dThe writers of this program were Liz Waid and Rena Dam.

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Adam Navis. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.You are on a train in Norway. The train will soon begin moving. You look out the front window. A mountain rises to your left. The sun shines brightly into your eyes. People standing next to the train wave excitedly. You begin to speed up. On the platform outside, you see a small boy with a warm hat on his head. He sits on his father\u2019s shoulders to watch the train better.Tracks for other trains cross the path in front of you. Now a red passenger train goes by in the opposite direction. A rock wall appears on your left. Leaves that have already changed to their fall colors are growing from between the rocks.Soon you come to a quiet country village. There are white and yellow houses on both sides. In front of you is a small, dark opening in the base of a mountain. It grows larger and darker by the second as your train speeds toward it. Your train is about to go underground! Now everything in front of you is black as night. The darkness is all you can see for the next four minutes. Then a little spot of light appears. That light tells you that you have reached the other side of the mountain. Soon you will see the sun again.This describes the first seven minutes of a seven-hour train ride across the country of Norway. This long train ride was recorded on video from beginning to end. It is the first popular example of Slow TV.Slow TV is a completely different form of television. In its most basic form, a person sets up a camera on a usually dull or normal activity \u2014 like riding a train. Sometimes the camera does not even move. Producers do not write a script. They do not make the video go faster or cut parts out. A person watching the video experiences the event in real time.The Slow TV train ride video was broadcast on public television in Norway in 2009. Public television in Norway is well-supported. The producers did not have to worry about how much money they could make through this program. They decided the idea was creative. And they were interested to see how people would react.The train ride was shown on TV on a Friday night. The producers expected that a few thousand people would watch the program. But information about the program spread quickly. That night more than a million people watched this slow train ride. This means more than three times as many people as usual watched TV that night. In fact, people enjoyed the recording so much that they wanted to see more like it. And they wanted the broadcast to stretch on for an even longer amount of time.The producers were surprised and excited. Their next Slow TV experiment was a boat trip along the coast of Norway. They recorded for five and a half days. All the video was broadcast live on public television. But about two days into the boat trip, something new began to happen. People began to visit the coast to be in the video. Thomas Hellum was one of the producers of the video. He told NPR:\u201cMore and more people singing, playing instruments, people along the coast and thousands of people showed up at every port, every mountain. They could go find the information and see, when will the boat be in my place? And they could prepare.\u201d The video showed people waving flags and holding up signs. Small boats sailed next to the large ship. The Queen of Norway waved to the camera from her own boat. Near the end of the trip, the many colors of a rainbow appeared above a green mountain. While the rainbow hung in the sky, this program broke a record. It was the largest number of people ever to watch a program in Norway at the same time.People in Norway continue to enjoy Slow TV. Producers have recorded many different long events. They have recorded meat production, making a coat, and fishing in a stream. And the idea has spread to other countries as well. People have made simple slow TV programs all around the world. However, Norway is the only country where the programs are popular on a national level.But is there anything for the average person to gain from Slow TV? With hundreds of normal programs to choose from, should you give Slow TV a try? There are several different ways that Slow TV can be of value.First, it is important to understand that not all people watch Slow TV in the same way. Even in Norway, only some people sit to watch a single program for hours on end. Many people think of the programs like having a pleasant friend in the room. They turn on the TV to a slow program. Then they continue with their work while the show plays next to them. Calming sounds and beautiful things to look at can be especially nice during lonely times.Another way that people from around the world enjoy Slow TV is as a sort of virtual . Maybe they do not have enough money for travel. Or maybe health worries are keeping them home. Watching Slow TV lets people experience other countries. They see through the eyes of someone else walking a street or riding on a train. As they watch the program, they can also read more about the place they are visiting. The place comes alive in their imagination.Finally, Slow TV can calm the mind. Most television programs speed up faster and faster. They follow simple plot lines with clear stories that are told quickly. Slow TV invites people to take the time to notice the details for themselves. No producer has decided what parts of the story are important. Everything stays in the recording. And just like in life, the person watching gets to decide which parts of the story are worth noticing and wondering about.Slow TV may never be as popular around the world as it is in Norway. But everyone can find things to enjoy about this kind of program. Are you ready to give Slow TV a try? We have made a . Check it out on our . Members will be able to see the video first.

I\u2019m Robin Basselin.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cWe are all under the same moon.\u201dThese are the words of film director, Kevin Macdonald. What do you think he meant when he said them?Macdonald said these words to the Telegraph news organization. And he was talking about a film he recently directed. A film called \u201cLife in a Day.\u201d Macdonald worked on this film with the famous film producer Ridley Scott. Together, they created this film about life around the world. However, they did not record it themselves. Instead, they used short films or videos recorded by people all over the world.Life in a Day is a film recorded by people like you. It shows the many differences between people and cultures. However, it also shows that there are things that connect all people \u2013 like the fact that we all live under the same moon. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the film Life in a Day.On July 1st, 2010, Kevin Macdonald released a video on the Internet. He used the popular video sharing website YouTube. Macdonald asked YouTube users to create a video of their life. And he asked everyone to do this on one particular day \u2013 July 24th, 2010.In his message, Macdonald asked YouTube users to film all parts of life. He wanted to see both normal and not normal life. He asked users to answer questions like \u201cWhat do you love?\u201d \u201cWhat do you fear?\u201d \u201cWhat makes you laugh?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you carry with you?\u201dMacdonald asked users to put their finished videos on YouTube. From these shared videos, Macdonald wanted to make one long film about global life. However, this is an unusual way to make a film. It uses a method called \u201ccrowd-sourcing.\u201d Crowd-sourcing is when a large group of people help complete a project usually done by a few paid workers. In crowd-sourcing, the group completes the project for less money or even for free. Usually, there is a public announcement for a crowd-sourced project. And often people use the Internet to send in their work.Crowd-sourcing can be helpful in completing many kinds of projects. For example, companies have used crowd-sourcing to find just the right picture for a particular project. Other people have used crowd-sourcing to find the answer to difficult science problems. In recent years, crowd-sourcing has become more and more popular. Now, Kevin Macdonald has made the first ever crowd-sourced film produced in Hollywood.At first, Macdonald did not believe the project would be very popular. However, people sent over 80,000 videos! And they sent them from over 190 countries. This made Macdonald and producer Ridley Scott believe that their idea could work.Macdonald and Scott paid 25 people to sort all the videos. These people spent months watching all 4,500 hours of film. Then Macdonald and Scott chose the best pieces of video. From these, they created the 95 minute film Life in a Day.Life in a Day began playing in theatres during the summer of 2011. The film includes great stories of birth and love. It also includes terrible stories of fear and death. One of the main stories from the film is about Okhwan Yoon. Yoon is a Korean man. He travels around the world on a bicycle. He rides this two-wheeled vehicle from country to country. His purpose is to teach peace, patience and discovery. He does this by meeting the local people. He talks with them about kindness. Yoon believes that understanding people is the first step of showing kindness. He has travelled to 191 countries to understand people everywhere.Another emotional part of the film shows a Japanese father and his young son, Taiji. They are in their apartment. This living space is dirty and not organized. There are many clothes on the floor. The boy quietly watches television. His father performs the morning work. Then they walk over to a large picture of a woman. The father lights a candle. The father and son honour the woman in picture. It is the man\u2019s wife and the boy\u2019s mother. And they are showing respect to her because she has died.The film\u2019s producers wanted the film to show life from all parts of the world. So, they sent 400 cameras to people living in places with little or no Internet connection. And these cameras produced some of the most beautiful parts of the film.One example is the story of a boy named Cain Able. Cain lives in Peru. And he is about 10 years old. Cain is friendly. And he works shining shoes. He does this because, like Taiji, his mother is dead. However, Cain is joyful. His smile makes everyone\u2019s day better. It brings joy to the people he meets in the film. It also brings joy to the people watching the film.Life in a Day is interesting because of its method and its message. When people watch it, they will see their own lives. They will also see what life is like for people who are not like them. But most importantly, they will see what is common to all people. As Macdonald told the Telegraph news organization,\u201cThis is what people chose to film. Those of us in the news and film industries think we know what films should be about. But most people are interested in a few, simple things \u2013 family, children, love, not being alone, not wanting to live through a war, feeling frightened of illness and death. That is it \u2013 that is what life is.\u201dWhat do you think about the idea of crowd-sourcing? Do you think it can make a great film? What would you put in a video about your life in a day?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Today, social media websites are a huge part of many people\u2019s lives. The website Facebook is only 10 years old. Yet more than 1 billion people use it! Websites like Facebook help people connect with each other, even when they live far away from each other. Social media websites can spread information very quickly. And most importantly, they are not limited by national borders. Using social media, citizens from different countries can communicate with each other. They can share ideas, learn about each other and become friends \u2013 even when they are supposed to be enemies. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on a social media movement that encourages friendship and peace between the citizens of two political enemies.For many years, the countries of Israel and Iran have had difficult political relations. News of disagreement and hostile words between these enemies is no surprise. But in 2012, relations between Israel and Iran got especially tense. News media and political leaders were talking about nuclear war. But many ordinary citizens, on both sides, did not want war.Ronny Edry was one of these people. Edry is an Israeli citizen. And he wanted to communicate a different message. Edry is a graphic designer. He uses computers to design and create images. On March 14th, 2012, he created a picture with a message. In the picture, Edry was holding his young daughter. And his young daughter was holding the flag of Israel. The words on the picture said, \u201cIranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.\u201d Edry put the picture on his Facebook website. The very next day, hundreds of people were talking about his picture on Facebook.Edry was surprised that even people from Iran were commenting on the picture. In a TED Talks speech, Edry explained,\u201cIn Israel, we do not talk with people from Iran. We do not know people from Iran. On Facebook you are only friends with your neighbours and friends.\u201dBut in just one day, Edry was communicating on Facebook with people from Iran. He was talking with people who were supposed to be his enemies. One young woman from Iran told Edry that she asked her whole family to come to her house to look at his picture. She said that they all sat together looking at her computer. And they were all crying. Edry could not believe it. He was shocked and emotionally touched by this response to his picture.But Edry\u2019s one picture was the beginning of something much bigger. Soon, hundreds of people began sending Edry pictures of themselves. They asked him to add the message from his image to their pictures. Edry received so many requests that he had to ask other graphic designers to help him. Israeli citizens from all over began posting pictures on Facebook with the same words: \u201cIranians, we will never bomb your country. We love you.\u201dBut Israelis were not the only ones to join Edry. Iranians also began to post pictures of their own. Graphic designers from Iran made many pictures that said, \u201cWe love you too\u201d and \u201cMy Israeli friends: I do not hate you. I do not want war.\u201d Suddenly, thousands of Israeli and Iranian citizens were communicating messages of love and peace to one another. This new community created two Facebook websites \u2013 one called \u201cIsrael loves Iran\u201d and another called \u201cIran loves Israel.\u201d In his TED Talk, Edry said,\u201cIt is a story that goes two ways. It is Israelis and Iranians sending the same message one to the other. This has never happened before. These are two people who are supposed to be enemies, close to war, and suddenly, people on Facebook are saying, \u201cI like this person. I love these people. It became very big.\u201dThe idea spread, and the movement for peace grew. In one week, 2 million people around the world visited the \u201cIsrael loves Iran\u201d Facebook website. And people in other countries began creating their own Facebook websites in support. Edry talked with the Christian Science Monitor news organization about the purpose of the movement. He said,\u201cWe are surrounded with images all of the time. The idea we have of the other side is made of images \u2026 Most of the time it is going to be bad images. These are the images you get from the news, from television every day. So the idea is to create new images.\u201dBut how much power do these new images have? Can they truly change things? It is easy to put an image on Facebook of someone holding a heart that says \u201cI love Iran.\u201d But does it have the same power as a news media image of world leaders signing a peace agreement? Edry believes his pictures do have great power. He believes that such pictures force people to see their enemies as human beings. And when this happens, it is much harder to want to kill them.It has been over two years since Edry put that first \u201cIsrael Loves Iran\u201d picture on Facebook. Since that time, Israel and Iran have not signed any peace agreements. Nor have they made any major changes in their policies. But hundreds of thousands of their citizens are connecting with each other in new ways through social media. And millions of people from around the world have visited the Facebook sites \u2013 liking and commenting on pictures, putting up their own pictures, and sharing their messages of peace.One of the earliest messages written on the \u201cIsrael Loves Iran\u201d Facebook page has been shared, liked and reposted again and again. It reads:\u201cTo all the fathers, mothers, children, brothers and sisters: For there to be a war between us, first we must be afraid of each other, we must hate. I am not afraid of you, I do not hate you.\u201dAnd this has been the message of the movement ever since. In his TED Talk, Edry encouraged all people to be part of the solution against war. He said,\u201cI know how the situation on the ground can look bad. For me, the courageous thing to do is to try to reach the other side before it is too late. Maybe by making an effort, we can avoid war. We can be our own ambassadors.\u201dDo you think normal citizens can be ambassadors for peace? Can social media movements help avoid war?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Colin Lowther. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Do you recognize this sound? It is the small high noise of the mosquito. Mosquitoes are small insects with wings. They bite people and take blood from their bodies. When mosquitoes bite people they leave behind a small raised red area on the skin. People with mosquito bites may feel like they need to keep rubbing or scratching their skin in this area. These little insects are a problem for people and animals in many parts of the world. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on mosquitoes. These interesting insects are a big problem.There are over 3,000 different kinds of mosquitoes. To some people, that is a very frightening fact! Many people know how dangerous mosquitoes can be. Some mosquitoes can carry diseases. They can give these diseases to people and animals. And some of these diseases cause death.But people can stop mosquitoes. Let\u2019s look at the life of the mosquito. When a female mosquito is full grown, she mates with a male mosquito. Then she begins searching for a \u201chost.\u201d A host is a person or animal that she can land on. A mosquito can sense a host from up to 35 meters away.Most mosquitoes do not travel very far. They usually travel less than a kilometer during their whole life. But some mosquitoes can travel far. Some mosquitoes can travel 160 kilometers in some conditions.When the female mosquito finds a host, she bites him.\u00a0 Mosquitoes have a special mouth. When a mosquito bites you, it actually puts part of its mouth under your skin. The mosquito also releases chemicals into your body. These chemicals make your blood flow faster into the mosquito. These chemicals are also responsible for the red bumps that many people experience after a mosquito bite.After a mosquito bites her host, she fills herself up with his blood. She is not eating this blood. Instead, she is storing it. This blood will be very important for her babies. They will use the protein in the blood.Only the female mosquito bites a host for her babies. For food, mosquitoes live on nectar, or sweet liquid that comes from plants. Male mosquitoes live for only a short time after they mate. But a female mosquito can have a few groups of babies without mating again.Mosquitoes grow through four separate periods of growth. These periods are called the egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This whole process takes about one to two weeks.When the female mosquito is ready, she lays her eggs. Different kinds of mosquitoes lay their eggs in different places. They can lay their eggs in a small container of water. Or they can lay their eggs in large wet fields. But all mosquitoes need to lay their eggs in some kind of water.Most eggs hatch in about two days. Then the baby mosquitoes are called larva. The larva lives in the water. During this stage, the larvae grow. They lose their skin four times. This is called \u201cmoulting.\u201d After their fourth moult, a larva begins the pupal stage.During the pupal stage, young mosquitoes begin to move. They float on the surface of the water. A special skin surrounds the pupa. Inside this skin, the pupa is changing into an adult mosquito. This process takes about two days. When the mosquito is completely developed the skin splits open. And the mosquito is now an adult!The adult mosquito comes out from the water. It must rest on the water to dry. Each part of its body must become hard. After its wings have dried, the mosquito can fly. And a short time after that, the mosquito can mate. Then the females go in search of blood to make more little mosquitoes. And the process begins again!Mosquitoes live in many areas of the world. But mosquitoes live best in a warm climate. And since they have so much contact with blood, they can be very dangerous. Mosquitoes can carry terrible viruses like west Nile, yellow fever, and  to humans and animals. These viruses create disease in their human hosts that can kill them. But not all mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. In fact, many mosquitoes do not carry viruses at all. However, it is difficult to know which mosquitoes are dangerous and which ones are not.Many people try to avoid mosquitoes. But have you ever noticed that mosquitoes seem to bite some people more than others? In fact, scientists believe that about 20 percent of people are more likely to get mosquito bites than others. Scientists who study mosquitoes believe that mosquitoes are attracted to, or pulled in, because of particular chemicals that come off people\u2019s bodies. Some people produce more of these chemicals than other people. Mosquitoes can also smell the chemicals in the air a person breathes out.There are ways to avoid mosquitoes \u2014 to stay healthy and for your own comfort. Here are some ways to avoid, stop, or kill mosquitoes near your home.First, do not let water sit for a long time. Mosquitoes need this still, stale water to lay their eggs. Experts say that this is the most important thing to do to avoid mosquitoes.Second, mosquitoes usually go out more in the early morning and early night. A person can avoid mosquitoes by not going out at these times.Third, in areas where mosquitoes are dangerous, use screens or nets over sleeping areas. These fabrics have many very small holes. The holes are big enough to let air through. But mosquitoes cannot fit through the holes. Also, nets that are treated with chemicals that kill insects are very helpful for stopping mosquitoes and malaria.Finally, when you can, wear clothes to cover most of your skin. Following these tips can help keep you free from mosquitoes.How do you avoid mosquitoes? Are they a problem where you live? Do they bite you? Tell us what about your experiences.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.\u201cI am the Secretary General of the United Nations. This is an organization that represents almost all of the humans of the planet Earth. I send greetings from the people of our planet. We step out of our Solar System into the Universe, seeking only peace and friendship. We know that our planet is a small part of this Universe that surrounds us. It is with humility and hope that we take this step.\u201dThis message was recorded in 1977 by the leader of the United Nations. The people making the recording wanted the message to last a long time. The best form at the time was a hard plastic disc, or vinyl record. However, to make it last longer, they made the record out of gold! They expected this record to survive for billions of years! Then they placed two copies of this \u201cgolden record\u201d on two Voyager Space ships. There were no people on either ship.The Voyager ships were launched into space later in 1977. They began to travel away from the earth at a speed of 16 kilometres each second. Thirty-five years later, in 2012, Voyager 1 finally left earth\u2019s solar system. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Golden Record each Voyager contained.Carl Sagan was one of the most famous astronomers of his time. He studied stars and planets. In 1976, he created a message to send into space. If people from other planets ever found it, this message would represent all of life on earth. Sagan thought this was a good idea. But there were some questions. What language best represented the whole earth? Should the message include music? What would sounds of nature mean to people from other planets?Sagan gathered together a few people he knew to help him choose the material. This was not an easy job. There was no Internet to search. Timothy Ferris was one of the people helping Sagan. He wrote about this for the New Yorker magazine.\u201cWe had to get physical copies of every recording we hoped to listen to or include. This was easy for American music. But we wanted things from all over the world; Australia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Congo, Japan, the Navajo Nation, Peru, and the Solomon Islands. It was difficult, involving, and wonderful work.\u201dFinding the audio was the first challenge. Choosing what to include was the second. The work was complex. They could not add everything they wanted. There was a limited amount of space.The work took less than a year to complete. But when the team was finished they believed they had captured all human life. There were 115 pictures. There were greetings in 55 languages. There were 12 minutes of sounds from Earth and 90 minutes of music.The pictures include many different things. There is the structure of human DNA. Two people eating and drinking. Olympic runners in motion. There are pictures of the Taj Mahal in India and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. There is also a picture of a page of a book. There are many different pictures of cities, roads, islands, maps, animals and nature.The music includes famous songs by Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. It also includes music from places like Peru, Japan, New Guinea, Bulgaria, Australia, Senegal, and Mexico.The sounds on the Golden record include volcanoes, earthquakes, and thunder. There is wind, rain, and the ocean against the sand. There are crickets and frog sounds. There are footsteps, a heartbeat, and laughter. There is also a tractor, a train, and an airplane. There are also the sounds of a mother and child.There are also spoken greetings from languages all over the world. Some of the greetings are in Arabic, Cantonese, Dutch, Hindi, Italian, Nepali, Russian, Vietnamese and many others. Sagan and his team knew that people in space would not be able to understand these languages. But they show the many different languages in our world.But does the Golden Record really represent all life on Earth? The Golden Record was made by a small number of people. These people were all from one part of the world \u2013 the United States. They also left out all the war and violence that is often part of human life. They wanted to present a happy, peaceful picture of life on earth. But is it even possible to capture all of life on Earth in this way? Is\u00a0it\u00a0worth trying?The world has also changed since 1977. One of these changes is the creation of digital media. A small computer can now hold millions of pictures, music and even video. But people from space may not know what to do with this technology. The Golden Record included details of how to use it. These instructions are complex. But they are still simpler than using digital media.Today, people can listen to a copy of the Golden Record. Alessandra Potenza is a writer for The Verge. She wrote about listening to the first Golden Record. She understood it was not perfect. But she still found it very emotional to listen to.\u201cI could not stop thinking how amazing it is to be part of this planet. I do not know what people from space would think of us if they ever found the Voyager Golden Record. Maybe it would make no sense to them. To me, the Golden Record shows me how beautiful our planet is and how special of a home it is. It is also a reminder that we should take better care of it.\u201dWhat would you want to include if you were making a new Golden Record? Would you include things about our violence and war? Or would you only include happy, peaceful things? You can leave a comment on our website. Or email us at radio@radioenglish.net.

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In 2004, a news reporter had a special story on Chinese television. The news reporter talked with a six-year-old girl. The reporter\u2019s name was Chai Jing. Chai worked for China Central Television. She was reporting in the village of Xiaoyi in the highly-polluted area of Shanxi. Shanxi has many coal plants, and the air is very dirty. Chai asked the little girl in Xiaoyi:Have you ever seen a real star?No.Have you ever seen blue sky?I have seen sky that was a little blue.Have you ever seen white clouds?No.Chai Jing could not forget about this little girl. Ten years later, she made a documentary film about air pollution in China. She called it \u201cUnder the Dome.\u201d Chai released her film on Saturday, February 28th, 2015. In three days, people had watched it more than 150 million times. In one week, people had watched it more than 300 million times. Around one fifth of China\u2019s population has seen it! Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the Under the Dome film.Less than 10 years after Chai talked with the little girl in Xiaoyi, she had her own baby girl. In fact, having her baby was the main reason she made the film. Chai was worried about her child. Chai lived in Beijing with her daughter. The air there is very polluted. Chai was careful with her daughter. She did not let her daughter play outside her house very often. Chai knew that one day, her little girl would ask her, \u201cMommy, why did you not let me outside to play?\u201d Chai wanted to have answers for her daughter. She spent her own money making the film. And she took a year researching three questions: One: What is pollution? Two: Where does it come from? And three: What can we do about it.In the film, Chai performed an experiment. In her home city of Beijing, she wore a pollution measuring device. She wore the device for 24 hours \u2013 one whole day. The device measured the kinds and amounts of pollutant chemicals in the air. Chai wore the device to her normal places, for her normal daily activities. The results of her experiment were shocking. In 24 hours on a normal day, Chai breathed in five times the legal amount of pollutants in China. And China\u2019s legal limits are three times as high as the World Health Organization\u2019s advised limits. Chai is especially concerned about Benzo[a]pyrene. This poisonous chemical causes cancer. On the day of the experiment, Chai breathed in 14 times the legal limit of Benzo[a]pyrene.China does have laws about pollution. It also has a Ministry of Environmental Protection, or MEP. In 2012, the government created an \u201cAir Pollution Prevention Plan.\u201d Officials began to measure and announce the amounts of pollutants in the air. But Chai\u2019s film shows one of the main problems. No one enforces the laws against pollution.In one part of the film, Chai is with MEP officials. They are driving on the road, and they see a truck with a black cloud around it. The cloud is so large Chai thinks something is on fire. But it is just the pollution coming from the truck. So Chai and the MEP officials follow the truck. They want to see where the truck is getting its fuel. Chai and the MEP officials find a public fuel station. They ask the owner if they can test the quality of the gas. The owner refuses. He takes their MEP identification and will not give it back. Chai protests. She tells the owner that the MEP officials have the responsibility and the authority to test the fuel. The owner says,\u201cYou have the responsibility, but not the authority.\u201dThis, Chai says, is the problem. Every day, individuals and businesses break environmental laws in China. But no one is punished. One MEP official told her,\u201cWe do the required steps. There is nothing we can do if the businesses do not stop. This is a kind of helplessness.\u201dThe film \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d was on the internet in China for one week. After that, the Chinese government began to block it on the internet. But it still had influence. After three weeks, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang talked publicly about enforcing pollution laws. He said,\u201cLast year I said that the Chinese government would declare a war against environmental pollution. This year we will work to make sure that the new environmental protection laws are enforced.\u201dChai Jing\u2019s film had a particular goal. The film asks the government to force factories and businesses to announce their pollution levels. These pollution levels should be public information. She also tells people to report broken rules to the MEP.In one part of the film, Chai gives an example of this. The building where she lives has a food restaurant. Every day, cooking smoke comes out of the restaurant. Chai thought this was normal. But then she discovered that there is a rule about cooking smoke. All restaurants should have smoke filters to block their pollution. So she called the MEP. Very shortly, the MEP put a smoke filter in the restaurant. After that, the smoke problem was solved. Chai said,\u201cWhen the pollution was bad, I did not know where I would be tomorrow, or where I would be in the future. But when the restaurant owner put in the smoke filter, I felt like my feet had landed on solid ground.\u201dChai Jing was happy when she saw the restaurant owner using the smoke filter. She knew that the difference to Beijing\u2019s air pollution was very small. But she said,\u201cOne person knows that because they did one small thing, the situation improved a little bit. So when you look back at the war between people and pollution, you see this is how history is made. It is tens of millions of ordinary people. One day they say \u2018No. I am not satisfied. I do not want to wait. I will stand up and do something. I will do it right now. At this time, at this place. I am going to do it.\u2019\u201dThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

I\u2019m Rena Dam.And I\u2019m Ryan Geertsma. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Picture a dark black sky. Suddenly, a large line of light appears. It looks like someone cut through the sky with a knife. The light shines through the opening.Now, the light begins to move. It gets softer. It starts to look green in colour. The lines of light move around the sky. They look like they may touch the ground very far away.Then, a burst of light appears! There are more colors now. They look like rays of sunshine all over the sky. The lights are changing very fast. They form a large . The curtain moves. It looks like it is dancing. The lights dance away back into the dark black sky.These lights in the sky are called the Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on these Northern Lights.Pierre Gassendi was a famous scientist and philosopher in the early 1600s.\u00a0 He was the one who named the Aurora Borealis. This name comes from Ancient Roman stories. Aurora was the name that Romans gave to the goddess of the dawn \u2013 the rising of the sun. The second half, Borealis, is named after the north wind. So in English Aurora Borealis means \u201cthe dawn of the north.\u201dIf you live in the Northern part of the world you may have seen the northern lights before. They also appear in the far south. There they are called the Aurora australis. The Northern Lights appear in many colors. People most often see green or red. The color is different depending on how far north or south you are. The Northern Lights also look different at different altitudes \u2013 they look different high up in the mountains than at sea level.But what are the Northern lights? What causes them? People have been wondering about this for years. The Northern lights are a part of folk culture in many countries. People around the world have traditional stories that explain the Northern lights. Here are a few of them:During the Viking period, people thought that the Northern Lights were images of young women who were dead. Other people believed that the northern lights were signs of huge fires in the north. And other people thought that it was God lighting up the cold, dark parts of the world.Inuit people believe that the lights are the land of the dead. They believe that dead friends in this land try to connect with living people. They think that this is what is happening when the lights change very fast.The lights often change shape and color. The Scots call them \u201cmerry dancers\u201d because of this movement. Some Native Americans believe that they can connect with spirits of the dead by whistling at the lights.Danish people have a traditional story about the Northern Lights. They say that a group of large white birds called swans once flew too far north. The swans got caught in the ice. They moved their wings up and down, flapping to get free. Every time they flapped their wings, they made images in the sky. These images became the northern lights.But not every country had a nice story about the Northern Lights like the Danish. Some cultures believed that the Northern Lights represented evil. They were afraid of the lights. They thought the lights were a terrible force. And many people believed that the Northern Lights caused natural disasters, like earthquakes or floods.These traditional stories are very interesting. But there is a scientific cause of the northern lights \u2013 !Sometimes there are storms on the sun. These storms release a cloud of solar particles into space. The solar particles are made up of atoms that have a magnetic charge. They are full of electric forces.Some of these magnetic solar particles come near to the earth. When they do, they are pulled in by the earth\u2019s magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls the particles to the two magnetic poles on the earth: the North Pole and the South Pole.The Northern Lights appear when the solar particles crash into the gas of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. More solar particles make the lights bigger and brighter. In certain years, the sun has more storms. During these times, the northern lights can be seen from farther away. They may also be larger than usual. Rachel VanderVeen lives in Northern Canada. She says that the year 2012 had many solar storms. She tells Spotlight what happened:\u201cMy husband does not often run. But one day he was walking home from school when the northern lights began. They moved across the dark sky in many colours. Even with the light from the town, they were amazing. Usually, we see the Northern Lights in bright green. But that day the colours made my husband run to find me. The lights were pink, purple and orange. We have lived in the north for many years now. That was the first time we have seen so many bright colours.\u201dYou can see why so many people believe that the Northern Lights are special. People travel from all over the world just to see the Northern Lights. But it is difficult to capture such an amazing sight.\u00a0 Some people spend days taking pictures of the lights.\u00a0 Other people try to describe the northern lights in words. Today\u2019s program ends with a part of a poem about the Northern Lights. It is called \u2018The Aurora Borealis\u2019 by S. Moore:The Aurora Borealis or northern light\nWith its movements so strangely bright,\nMoving and dancing along the sky \u2013\nA picture of beauty to please the eye.\n\nHow sweetly the shining particles fly!\nHow quickly the flashes of light in the sky!\nYou would think the young angels had gathered in crowds\nTo play hide-and-seek through the golden clouds,\n\nLet wise philosophers search out the cause,\nAnd tell me the Science of Nature\u2019s laws;\nAnd how these magnetic rays of light\nEnrich the north of a frosty night.\n\nSo let the stories be what they may,\nI love to look on the bright display\nOf the ever moving, changing hues,\nSeen in these grand but short lived views.The writers of this program were Sara DeKoster and Rena Dam.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Storms. Floods. Mudslides. Tsunamis. Earthquakes. Most people know about the dangers of these natural disasters. But there is another natural disaster that can be just as dangerous as any of these. It is the heat wave.Heat waves can have deadly results. The World Health Organization says that between 1998 and 2017 over 160,000 people died because of extreme temperatures. But even without a heat wave, hot weather can be very dangerous. Working outside in the hot sun can affect people more than they know.People often do not recognize the changes in their bodies in hot weather. Or they may not know what to do to avoid the dangers of hot weather. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on how people can stay safe in hot weather.A heat wave is a period of hot weather that lasts for several days. Heat waves are common. Some heat waves last only a few days, but heat waves can last much longer. Heat waves are the most dangerous when they last for more than a few days.Experts say that heat causes the most damage when outside temperatures stay high day to night. The middle of the day is usually the hottest. And then at night the temperature is cooler. A healthy person\u2019s body can adapt, or change, during the day so that hot weather is not as dangerous to his body. Then, at night when the temperature is cool, his body can rest from the heat. But, if the temperature does not cool down at night, this causes serious problems for his body. His body has no time to recover.The human body reacts to heat through its own cooling system. When we get too hot, our skin begins releasing water on its surface. This sweat on the outside of the body evaporates into the air. As the sweat evaporates off the body, the person gets cooler.This natural cooling system works well for short periods of time. But it is possible for a person to release too much water as sweat. If he does not put enough water back into his body, he could become dehydrated. Dehydration is one of the most common problems in hot weather or a heat wave. Someone who is dehydrated may have trouble thinking or working. This is because lack of water affects the working of the brain.Someone who is dehydrated should avoid working too hard and sweating. He needs to put water back into his body. So, he should also drink lots of water. If he does not, his dehydration could lead to more serious problems.There are three main illnesses that come from extreme heat. These are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.Heat cramps are quick painful muscle movements that a person cannot control. A person can get heat cramps when she is in very hot weather and has not had enough water. They are most common when a person has also been doing a lot of physical activity. If a person has heat cramps, you should move her to a cool place. Then give her plenty of liquids. A sports drink is a good choice. But coconut water, , or water are also very good in this situation.Heat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. A person with heat exhaustion may have cool wet skin. He may sweat a lot and feel dizzy or faint. He may feel as if he will be sick or have a headache. His heart will beat quickly, but weakly. He may even fall to the ground. If it is not treated, it can be very serious.Heat exhaustion can develop quickly. But it may also develop slowly over a few days. Often, the victim may not even observe the changes and problems happening in his body.During heat exhaustion, his body is trying to make his body temperature normal again. You can help his body cool down. A person with heat exhaustion should immediately stop working. He should rest in a cool place. They should remove any warm clothing. You can give him cool, wet clothes to put on his skin. And most importantly, he should drink liquids like sports drinks, coconut water, milk, or water.If heat exhaustion goes untreated, it may develop into heatstroke. This is the most damaging and dangerous problem that comes from hot weather. During heatstroke a person\u2019s average body temperature rises to over 40 degrees Celsius.One sign of heatstroke is that the person becomes confused. He may not be able to answer simple questions. The person\u2019s skin may be dry and red or lighter than normal. He may feel as if he will be sick. And he may take short fast breaths and have a fast but quiet heartbeat.If his body temperature rises above 42 degrees, his body will even begin to damage his organs. This can result in permanent brain damage or even death. A person suffering from heat stroke must get treatment immediately.If you think someone is suffering from heat stroke, it is very important to help them. Here is what you can do. Remove the person from the heat. Take off his clothes and pour cool water over his body. The water will begin to evaporate and help to cool him down.

I\u2019m Joshua Leo.And I\u2019m Liz Waid. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.This beautiful music is made with a sitar. This is a traditional musical instrument from India. It looks a bit like another popular instrument called a guitar. On one end of the sitar is a round empty gourd. This deep rounded base makes the sound louder and more complex. From this base comes a long flat stick called the \u201cneck.\u201d Almost 30 strings, like thin ropes, go up and down the neck. The sitar player plays seven of these strings. He pulls on them with his fingers. The remaining strings make noise as the musician plays the other strings above them.This instrument is very complex and beautiful. It is one of the major instruments in the traditional music of India. But people all around the world know and love sitar music. How did this instrument become popular in countries far from India? There is one musician who helped encourage people\u2019s love of sitar music more than anyone else. Some people call him the father, or founder, of world music. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the famous Indian musician Ravi Shankar.Ravi Shankar was born in India in 1920. When he was 10 years old he moved to Europe. His brother led a dance group that performed traditional Indian music and dancing. Shankar learned to dance and joined his brother\u2019s group. Shankar also learned about many cultures and customs. He learned many kinds of music. But he loved music from India the best. Shankar noticed that people from other cultures also loved Indian music. He told the writer Thakur Paramjit:\u201cI listened carefully to our music. I observed the reaction of audiences on hearing it. This watching and judging helped me. I decided what we should give to Western audiences to make them respect and enjoy Indian music.\u201dWhen he turned 18 Ravi Shankar moved back to India. He went to live with a famous musician named Allauddin Khan. Khan became Shankar\u2019s teacher and spiritual guide. Shankar spent six years living and studying with Khan. He learned classical Indian music styles and instruments. But the instrument Shankar loved most was the sitar.Shankar soon became a well-known musician and composer in India. He wrote music for the National Theatre. He worked as the director for All India Radio for many years. Shankar established the Indian national orchestra in the mid-1950s. People in India loved Ravi Shankar\u2019s music. He performed in many live concerts. Shankar also wrote and performed music for some of the most popular Indian films at the time.Ravi Shankar\u2019s fame began to spread beyond India too. Many people in other countries began to enjoy sitar music. Western musicians became interested in learning to play Indian traditional music. They even played western and eastern music together. They made music that mixed the traditions from different countries and cultures. This style of music is sometimes called world music.Ravi Shankar became friends with many famous people. One of the most famous was the British musician George Harrison. Harrison was a member of the rock band The Beatles. He first met Shankar in London. Then Harrison visited Shankar in India. Shankar taught Harrison to play the sitar. Soon, millions of people heard sitar music in songs by The Beatles. Ravi Shankar told Shashi Vyas in an interview:\u201cI was one of the first when I first started to experiment with western instruments and western musicians. George Harrison came to me because he was so interested in our music. And he became my student. He did not do it only because it was popular at the time. He loved it until the end and became very very dear to me.\u201d\u00a0Ravi Shankar played his sitar in many concerts all over the world. The largest event that Shankar organized was a concert for Bangladesh. At that time, there were many problems in Bangladesh. Ravi Shankar wanted to help. He asked George Harrison to help him organize a concert for Bangladesh. It became a huge music event. Shankar, Harrison and others gathered 250,000 US dollars for the people of Bangladesh.Because Ravi Shankar had a great influence on music all over the world, some people criticised him for not being traditional enough. But Shankar always kept an Indian approach to music. He said:\u201cI have experimented with non-Indian instruments, even electronic ones. But all my experiences were based on traditional Indian songs. When people discuss tradition, they do not know what they are talking about. Over centuries, classical music has had elements added to it. It has had changes and improvements. But it has always held to its traditional base. Today, the difference is that the changes are faster.\u201dRavi Shankar often played with musicians who used other styles of music. But he always kept the important parts of Indian folk music. For example, he was always free to change the music while playing. Even when playing with many other musicians Shankar would not always follow the music exactly as it was written. He would play what he felt sounded good. He did not always follow the set rules that some western music uses. Shankar told Sashi Vyas:\u201cMusic rises above all languages and barriers. It is the most beautiful communication skill one can have. Music makes us all experience different emotions. Different kinds of music, whether it is by voice or instrument, Eastern or Western, Classical or Pop or folk from any part of the world, can all be spiritual. Music has the power to move the spirit of a person as if there is no time.\u201dThis power to move people\u2019s spirits was Ravi Shankar\u2019s gift through music. He died in 2012 at the age of 92. Ravi Shankar was more than a sitar player. He was also a teacher and example for many people.\u00a0 His two daughters, Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar, are also both successful musicians. Musician Lalgudi Jayaraman explains exactly why people will never forget Ravi Shankar:\u201cHis connection with music was driven by reason all through. The high quality of his music shows that spirit. Ravi Shankar loved and enjoyed good music. He came to it with child-like excitement even after becoming a world-known master. Only such an attitude to art can bring out influential music like his.\u201dThe writers of this program were Shelagh Godwin and Rena Dam. The producer was Rena Dam.

Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand no matter where in the world they live.This song is called \u201cPop Pop Pop.\u201d It is sung by the female music group Rania. Rania is a popular or \u2018pop\u2019 music group from South Korea. There are six girls in the group. They sing, dance, and create some of the most popular music in Asia. They also travel all around Asia and perform their music. Rania is a \u201cKPOP\u201d music group. The \u201ck\u201d in KPOP comes from the word \u201cKorean.\u201d\u00a0 But People all over Asia listen to KPOP. The songs are top hits in many countries \u2013 countries as far away from South Korea as the Philippines. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on KPOP.Korean Popular Music \u2013 or, KPOP \u2013 is similar to American and British \u201cPop\u201d music. The term \u201cPop\u201d music became  in the 1950s. People used the term to describe popular rock and roll music.\u00a0 Like early \u201cPop\u201d music, KPOP uses a lot of very fast beats. The music often repeats and is very easy to remember.American hip-hop music has also had a large influence on KPOP. Hip-hop started to become popular in the United States in the 1970s. It had many influences \u2013 like jazz and rock and roll music. Hip-hop is different than most music.\u00a0 In most music, the performer sings the words. But in hip-hop, the performer speaks the words to the beat. The first famous hip-hop song was called \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d It was performed by a band called The Sugarhill Gang. It sounds like this,You can hear this kind of singing or rapping in many KPOP songs. It is even in the \u201cPop, Pop, Pop\u201d song from the beginning of this program. The singer raps in Korean to the beat of the song:KPOP music is also very easy to dance to. The rhythm or beat is clear and easy to follow.\u00a0 Restaurants, bars and dance clubs all over Asia play KPOP for people to dance to. It is rare to find KPOP songs that are slow. This is because making the song easy to dance to is extremely important. The beat and sound are often even more important than the words.KPOP shares many similarities with other kinds of global popular music. However, there is one thing that makes it unique or different. KPOP often combines the Korean and English languages. For example, there is a song called \u201cBad Girl, Good Girl\u201d by Miss A. This song starts in English. It says, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, so shut up boy.\u201d Then it quickly changes into Korean. Listen:This use of English in KPOP is not surprising.\u00a0 Most young Koreans speak some English or are learning English. Often, they speak what people call \u201cKonglish.\u201d\u00a0 Konglish is a mixture of Korean and English. Often Koreans will speak mostly Korean, but use some English words instead of Korean words.\u00a0 Sometimes, they will even use long groups of English words.\u00a0 However, these phrases will be highly influenced by Korean.Tory Thorkelson is a professor at Hangyang University in South Korea. He says that Konglish often borrows words from English. But sometimes these English words are given new, Konglish meanings.A good example is the word \u2018meeting.\u2019 In English, meeting means \u2013 the act of two or more people coming together.\u00a0 A meeting can be for work, school, community or even religion. However, in Konglish, \u201cmeeting\u201d means a particular kind of meeting. It is a meeting between two people. They are looking for love and they have never met before. In English, people would call this a \u201cblind date.\u201d In Konglish, it is just a \u201cmeeting.\u201dKPOP\u2019s international success is also changing how some cultures see South Korea. Sue Jin Lee is a Communications student at Elon University in the United States. She wrote a research paper about the Korean wave. The Korean wave is a term people use to explain the spread of Korean popular culture in Asia. She writes,\u201cThe clearest effect that the Korean wave has had is improving the Korean national image. South Korea is reinventing their national image. Countries in the world are always shaping and reshaping their national images. They do this as they compete with other countries for power and influence.\u201dKPOP is a major part of the Korean wave.\u00a0 And it has helped change the way Asian countries see South Korea.\u00a0 Lee writes,\u201cMany experts and news writers have questioned why Korean popular culture became such a powerful force in Asia. Most people like cultural products that are similar to their own culture. So, it is not surprising that Korean cultural products are successful. Asian people feel closer to Korean culture than to Western culture.\u201dHowever, some people think KPOP and the Korean wave have given South Korea too much cultural influence and power.\u00a0 Lee writes,\u201cWhen the Korean wave first developed and moved into Asia, Japanese newspapers had a hostile attitude toward Korean issues. Chinese newspapers criticized the increase in Korean television shows and businesses\u2026\u201dHowever, no one can argue KPOP\u2019s global appeal. It is crossing cultural divisions.\u00a0 And it is building relationships between countries.In fact, the spread of KPOP has not stopped with Asia. Its influence is spreading around the world. Donika Sterling is a 15-year-old girl from New York City. She suffers from a disease with no cure. She cannot walk. And she has gone through many operations to fight her disease. Her life is different than many girls her age. But like many people her age, she loves music \u2013 in particular KPOP.Donika loves to listen to KPOP over the internet.\u00a0 And in June of 2012, she went on a very exciting trip. She travelled to Seoul, South Korea.\u00a0 There, she met members of her favorite KPOP music groups.This experience was powerful both for Donika and the KPOP groups she met. Donika told the Internet website KPOPstarz:\u201cI still cannot believe I am in Korea. I thank everyone who helped me make my dreams come true.\u201dSHINee is a member of the KPOP group Taemin. He told KPOPstarz,\u201cI was happy to hear about Donika coming to Korea to meet us. I was very amazed to hear that Donika is encouraged by our music.\u201dDo you listen to KPOP music?

I\u2019m Liz Waid.And I\u2019m Bruce Gulland. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Alone in her room, a young girl sits down and begins reading a book. The book is a very famous one. It is called \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry.\u201d It tells the story of Cassie Logan and her family. They live in the United States in the 1930s. And they are African Americans. In those times, the state of Mississippi had a severe problem with racism. The government allowed people to make life difficult for African Americans, and people with darker skin colour. Often, groups of white men killed black men and women without punishment. It was a very frightening time.But the young girl does not know this. She knows little about American history. She is growing up many years later, in the 1970s. The situation in the United States has improved. But reading the book helps the young girl understand Cassie Logan\u2019s fear, and her other emotions. The girl reading is white. She lives in a very small town, where there are no black people. But the book helps her see what it is like to be different. When she finishes the book, she is crying. That night, she tells herself she will never judge another person by what they look like. The book has changed her life. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on how reading can help people understand each other.There is a name for the emotion the girl felt while reading the book. It is . There are two different kinds of . The first lets people sense other people\u2019s emotions. It is what happens when we feel sad because another person is sad. Or it helps us understand that a person is angry, even when they will not say.The second kind of empathy is called cognitive empathy. This is what happens when a person reads a book. Cognitive empathy happens when a person tries to identify and understand another person\u2019s emotions. Some people even imagine that they\u00a0\u00a0the other person. There is even an old English idiom for cognitive empathy: taking a walk in another person\u2019s shoes. It means to imagine that you have lived their life.Scientists do not yet know exactly what happens in a person\u2019s brain when they feel empathy. It is a very complex process. But scientists have observed it happening. They believe empathy involves a brain cell called a mirror neuron. These cells work when we observe other people. Mirror neurons send messages through the brain. This is called \u201cfiring\u201d. When these cells fire, they help us to identify emotions we see. But the same kind of cell also fires when we HAVE that emotion. So, when we are sad, a mirror cell will fire. But when we\u00a0\u00a0someone who is sad, that same cell fires. We can understand an emotion. And through mirror neurons, we feel that emotion ourselves. is very important in society. Without empathy we would not help each other. We would not care for each other. As a feeling, empathy makes us want to help. It makes us want the world to be a better place.Barack Obama is the former president of the United States. In 2006, he made a speech to the graduates of Northwestern University. He described how empathy influences how people act.\u201cThink of a child who is hungry or the steel worker who no longer has a job. Or think of the family whose home was destroyed by a storm. When you have empathy, it does not matter if they are close friends or far-away strangers. It is difficult not to act. It is hard not to help.\u201dMost people have empathetic feelings. But people can train themselves to be more empathetic. However, this takes work. Meeting people who are different than we are is one way to gain empathy. But distance often divides people. So it is difficult for people to understand each other when they never meet.Reading may be a solution for this. The girl who read \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear my Cry\u201d, did not know any African Americans. But the book helped her understand the life of a person who was. Cassie Logan was not a real person. But her situation was real. And the girl understood Cassie\u2019s feelings. From the book, the girl learned a little of what it was to be African American. She felt like she could understand.David Kidd is a psychologist. He studies the science of how people behave. Kidd works at the New School for Social Research in New York. In 2012, he helped show that reading increases empathy. In a test, he made people read different kinds of books. Some of these books were literary fiction, or complex invented stories. These stories made people think about the emotions of the characters in them. After reading these literary fiction books, the people were better able to understand what other people were thinking. And they could more easily identify emotions.Keith Oatley is another psychologist. He also studies how reading connects to empathy. He tells the Washington Post newspaper,\u201cWhen we read about other people, we can imagine that we are in their position. We can imagine what it\u2019s like being that person. That lets us better understand people and to work together better.\u201dMany studies say that the effect of reading on empathy only works for complex fictional, or invented, stories. That is because this kind of writing concentrates on a character\u2019s thoughts and feelings. This helps the reader to feel like they are inside the character\u2019s head and thoughts. This produces the effect that leads to empathy.Today, many scientists believe that books are good tools for increasing empathy. But for readers, and many writers, this is not a new discovery. Together, they have made and explored new worlds and places. They have looked at how different people think and live. Stories have taken them places they may have never gone before.Have you ever read a book that changed you? How did it make you feel? Tell us about your experiences.

I\u2019m Colin Lowther.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.During World War II, American and British forces bombed the city of Dresden, Germany. More than 22,000 people died in this terrible act of war. The bombs also destroyed many works of art, literature, and music. A short time after the war, a musician named Remo Giazotto was in Dresden. He was looking through the remains of old buildings. He found some pieces of paper with notes on them. They were directions for playing music.Giazotto believed it was music by the famous 18th century musician Albinoni. But Giazotto only found part of the music. So he looked at the rest of Albinoni\u2019s musical pieces. He used these to complete the piece of music he found. Most experts think that Giazotto wrote the music himself. But people still call the music \u201cAlbinoni\u2019s Adagio.\u201dThis song became a symbol. It shows that beauty can survive through conflict and war. Albinoni\u2019s Adagio became even more famous during another war. In 1992, enemies surrounded the European city of Sarajevo. A musician named Vedran Smailovi\u0107 played Albinoni\u2019s Adagio in the street. He played often, even though it was very dangerous. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on the actions and influence of the cellist Vedran Smailovi\u0107.In the 1990s, the former country of Yugoslavia experienced a terrible conflict. Different ethnic groups in the country fought each other for control. For more than three and a half years, the city of Sarajevo was under siege. Enemy soldiers completely surrounded the city. They blocked important supplies coming in. Citizens could not leave Sarajevo. It was the longest siege in the history of modern war.Thousands of people died during the Siege of Sarajevo. They could not get enough food or medical care. Many people were also killed by snipers. Sniper soldiers with guns hid in buildings. They shot people from far away, including children. Bombs also destroyed people\u2019s homes and city hospitals. And, like Dresden, Sarajevo lost a lot of important cultural property.Before the siege, Sarajevo had many wonderful artists and musicians. One important musician was named Vedran Smailovi\u0107. He played a large stringed instrument called the cello. When the siege began, Smailovi\u0107 was hopeful about peace. He did not believe that the siege would last a long time. But on May 27th 1992, something changed him.It was difficult to find food in Sarajevo at this time. One morning, many people stood in a long line. They were waiting for fresh bread at one of the last working bakeries. Suddenly, soldiers fired a bomb into the middle of the line. It killed 22 people and injured many others.After this tragic event, Vedran Smailovi\u0107 decided to use his cello to protest the war. Smailovi\u0107 held the large cello between his knees. With one hand he pressed four long strings. Smailovi\u0107\u2019s other hand pulled a long straight bow over the strings. He played beautiful music in the middle of the war. The song he played was Albinoni\u2019s Adagio.Smailovi\u0107 played this song every day for 22 . Each day represented one person who was killed at the bakery. Albinoni\u2019s Adagio was a fitting piece of music to play. The history of the song was like Smailovi\u0107\u2019s act. It presented something beautiful in the middle of death and destruction. It was a song of hope. Every day Smailovi\u0107 chose a different place to play. He played in the middle of a street, or in a ruined home, or a bombed building. He even dressed up in a formal suit. This was the same suit that he used to wear to play for famous people.Smailovi\u0107 talked to a BBC reporter, Malcolm Brabant. He told Brabant that he wanted to make the world remember these people.\u201cI play for the dead people. They are my friends, it is in my city, in my street, it is in my country. I play for my dead friends, and I play for the future, for a better future. It will be, I am sure.\u201dSmailovi\u0107 did not stop playing his cello after his 22-day protest. He would often play at funerals. In August of 1992, bombs completely destroyed the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This library was the centre of knowledge and culture for the whole area. Smailovi\u0107 also played his cello in the remains of the destroyed library.In 1993, Smailovi\u0107 escaped from Sarajevo. But his courage gave many people hope. David Wilde is an English musician. He wrote a song for the cello called \u201cCellist of Sarajevo.\u201d The song was about Smailovi\u0107. In 1994, the world famous cellist Yo Yo Ma performed this song. He played it at the International Cello Festival in England. When Yo Yo Ma finished playing, he remained bowed over his instrument. The whole room was very quiet. Then, Yo Yo Ma stood up and raised his hand. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Vedran Smailovi\u0107 walked forward! He had been watching the performance. Musician Paul Sullivan was there. He described it later in Hope magazine.\u201cThe emotion was unbelievable. Everyone jumped to their feet, cheering loudly, crying, shouting and putting their arms around each other. It carried us away in a huge wave of emotion. And in the centre of it stood these two men holding each other, both crying freely.\u201dVedran Smailovi\u0107\u2019s example continues to give people courage in times of war and conflict. In April of 2015, a car bomb killed several people in Baghdad, Iraq. It was 20 years after the Siege of Sarajevo. Karim Wasfi is an Iraqi musician. He played his cello at the place of the bombing. We end today\u2019s program with Wasfi\u2019s moving words. He told the BBC,\u201cI want to bring beauty in the life of Iraq now. Music is one of the most important ways to do that. I cannot stop the bombs with my cello. But I will continue to make music to show life is still worth experiencing and living.\u201dThe writer of this program was Jen Hawkins.

I\u2019m Bruce Gulland.And I\u2019m Christy VanArragon. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.Do you know a child who likes to say, \u201cNo!\u201d? As any parent knows, children sometimes refuse to do what a parent tells them to do. It can be very difficult for parents.Sometimes, children march around angrily, lie on the ground, or even hit. This is not much fun for parents or children. But there is tool that can help. Sticker charts are one way to praise, punish and teach children. And they help parents stay calm and in control. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on sticker charts.It is difficult to raise children. Even well-behaved children can cause problems. Parents want their children to grow into healthy, strong adults. But it is difficult to know the best way to do this. Parents may try punishing, shaming, shouting or hitting. But these methods teach children to deal with their problems using violence. However, one method that has worked for many people is a sticker chart.A chart is any piece of paper with a series of squares. The squares are where parents will place the stickers. Stickers are pieces of paper that will attach, or stick, to other things. They come in many shapes and sizes. They can be shaped like animals, faces, stars, or something else the child enjoys. When a child does something good, the parent attaches a sticker to the square on the chart. And if a family cannot use stickers, they can write a special mark or picture in the chart. When the child has filled all the squares with stickers or marks, she receives a prize.Here is how you use the sticker chart. Imagine a child leaves his toys where they do not belong. His parents want him to clean up at the end of the day. They tell their son that every time he cleans up his toys, they will put a sticker on the chart. They ask him what a good prize would be for filling the chart. He says, \u201cI want to help cook a meal!\u201d Everyone agrees this is a good prize.They put the chart where the child can see it. Their son still sometimes forgets to put away his things. So his parents simply do not award a sticker for that day. But their son wants more stickers so he begins to put away his things more often. And when he fills his chart, he gets to help cook a meal. It is a fun event the whole family can enjoy.Before creating a sticker chart, Child Psychologist Erin N. King says there are a few things to remember.First, the goal should be stated positively. It is better to say, \u201cJohn will keep his hands to himself.\u201d than, \u201cJohn will not hit other children.\u201dSecond, think about how long the child must behave. It is difficult for a child to behave all day. If she makes a mistake in the morning, she will have no reason to behave for the rest of the day.Finally, only concentrate on one or two behaviours at one time. Children are still learning how to control themselves. Too many goals can be too much to remember.You must also consider the age and ability of each child. If a sticker chart is too complex, the child will not be able to understand it.You may also let the child create the sticker chart, and choose the goals and prizes. This will help the child feel involved. It will increase the chance that the sticker chart will work to change behaviour.Sticker charts have several advantages for parents. They do not require parents to shout at, hit, or shame the child. Those methods teach children to solve problems with violence. When parents have a bad day, they may be less able to deal with children than on a good day. But sticker charts help stop parents from letting how they\u00a0\u00a0influence how they\u00a0\u00a0their children.And children like sticker charts too! Children need structure they can depend on. This makes them feel safe. Feeling safe is an important part of learning and growing. Sticker charts show children what parents expect of them. They also show progress. Children can see what they have done. They can follow along as they work toward a goal.Sticker charts do not always work. Some children are too young. A good age to begin is around three years old. As children grow, both their goals and prizes need to grow too. A sticker chart will not work if the goals are too simple or the prizes too small.Sticker charts also do not work unless parents also follow the rules. When a child does not earn a sticker, some parents will feel bad. They will still give her a sticker. This teaches her that her parents will give her what she wants even if she does not behave.And finally, some children just do not seem to care about sticker charts. This can be difficult for parents \u2013 especially when one child reacts well to sticker charts and another child does not.But sticker charts are not a perfect tool, even if people use them correctly. Erica Reischer is a family Psychologist. She helps families to work through problems together. She argues that tools like sticker charts can be harmful to children. She says that children begin to expect awards for ALL good behaviour. They affect a child\u2019s own personal desire to do good things. A child may be less likely to help or behave if they do not get a sticker for doing it.So how can parents know if using a sticker chart is good or bad for their children? Sticker charts can be a way for children to learn right behaviour. It is easy to try this method and think about how it is affecting your family. And it is important to remember that the relationship between parent and child is always more important than a tool like a sticker chart.Do you think a sticker chart would change how you act?

I\u2019m Adam Navis.And I\u2019m Katy Blake. Spotlight uses a special English method of broadcasting. It is easier for people to understand, no matter where in the world they live.In the past 100 years people have invented only one popular musical instrument that does not use electricity. Do you know what it is? It sounds like this.Have you heard music like this before? It is called a steel pan. There are hundreds of different groups playing steel pan music. It is played for presidents and for kings. It is played in famous music centres. But steel pan music is connected most closely to one place: the island countries of Trinidad and Tobago. Today\u2019s Spotlight is on steel pan music.The history of Trinidad and Tobago is full of struggle. Over the years, many countries have occupied Trinidad and Tobago. At different times, Spain, The Netherlands, France, and Britain have each controlled these islands. People also came to the islands to escape from trouble or trial in their home country.While many people came because they wanted to, many did not. The French brought African people to the island as slaves. Soon there were more enslaved people than free people. Around the year 1800 there were about 17,000 people on the islands. Ten thousand of these people were enslaved. Several years later, Britain took control of the islands and banned the slave trade.The French did not only bring slaves to the islands. They also brought the tradition of Carnival. Carnival is also called Mardi Gras. It is a celebration before the Christian season of Lent. As they did in Paris, French people marched through the streets singing, dancing, and playing music. The former slaves joined the parade too. They brought their own drums and began adding their own beats to the celebration.People usually make drums by stretching animal skin over an open container. On the islands, people used these drums to communicate across great distances. Although the British ruler had banned the slave trade, the British would not give up control of the islands. And they were afraid the people would use the drums to send secret messages of revolt. So, in 1883, Carnival was celebrated but the government banned the drums.Many people did not want to give up their drums. The enslaved people had lost many things \u2013 their families, their own languages, and their religion. Music was one connection to the past. And drumming gave them a way to express their emotions without words. Also, they missed out on taking part in celebrating Carnival.So people found a way to keep drumming. Every time the government banned one kind of drum, the people found a new one. For example, people started to use bamboo. This plant grows in a large tube shape. The people would cut different sizes of bamboo and strike them together or hit them on the ground. This was called Tamboo Bamboo.The Tamboo-Bamboo groups soon became large. They even began to fight over who was the best. Some even made their instruments into sharp pointed weapons. Also, many people were harvesting bamboo illegally. So in 1934 the British government banned Tamboo-Bamboo instruments.This did not stop people from inventing more new drums. In 1936, a music group brought new steel drums to Carnival. This was the beginning of steel pan.People made these first steel pans from bread containers, paint containers, or waste containers. They were so popular that soon the young people of Trinidad were stealing every waste container they could find. Young people even took locked waste containers!Sterling Betancourt grew up in Trinidad and Tobago. He told the BBC how people invented the steel pan. It was never a plan. He says:\u201cIt was a very slow process. Everyone got together and invented the steel pan by using pots and pans and testing them out. The sound and the notes came. But we did not think about it \u2014 we just did it.\u201dThey made steel pans by shaping the bottom of the containers with heavy tools. They shaped different thicknesses on different parts. This created many notes on a single pan. The steel pan was now able to play whole songs! It was still a drum, but a new kind of drum.During World War Two the music of steel pan became popular with American soldiers. They were living at a navy base in Trinidad. The navy base also brought a new resource for making steel pan instruments: oil containers!The navy ships needed oil. The oil came in large 208-liter containers. When the containers were empty, they were perfect for making steel pans. The oil containers were thick metal and lasted much longer than other materials.After World War Two began the most popular time for steel pan music. Music groups set up steel pan music celebrations. Different steel pan groups would gather and compete against each other. As Trinidad and Tobago became more independent, steel pan became a more respected kind of music.In 1962, Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation. Steel pan music was played at the national celebration. This was an important event for steel pan as well as for Trinidad and Tobago. This music was once banned street music. But now it had risen into a respected music form. It was part of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s national character.Today, steel pan music has travelled around the world. Now people outside Trinidad and Tobago play it too. There are more than 800 steel pan groups in the world. Three hundred are in Britain. There are 240 in the United States. In Switzerland, there are 130 groups and 70 percent of Swiss pan players are women.Even while it is popular around the world, steel pan music is still closely linked with the culture of Trinidad and Tobago. Steel pan was the music of the poor, of the oppressed, and of former slaves. But like the people of Trinidad and Tobago, steel pan music rose up and demanded to be heard.Do you enjoy steel pan music?
